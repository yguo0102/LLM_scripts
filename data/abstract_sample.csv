3,10.1161/01.STR.0000014509.11540.66,"Background and Purpose— Among patients with acute stroke, high blood pressure is often associated with poor outcome, although the reason is unclear. We analyzed data from the International Stroke Trial (IST) to explore the relationship between systolic blood pressure (SBP), subsequent clinical events over the next 2 weeks, and functional outcome at 6 months in patients with acute stroke. Methods— We included in the analysis 17 398 patients from IST with confirmed ischemic stroke. A single measurement of SBP was made immediately before randomization. Clinical events within 14 days of randomization were recorded: recurrent ischemic stroke, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, death resulting from presumed cerebral edema, fatal coronary heart disease, and death. Survival and dependency were assessed at 6 months. Outcomes were adjusted for age, sex, clinical stroke syndrome, time to randomization, consciousness level, atrial fibrillation, and treatment allocation (aspirin, unfractionated heparin, both, or neither). Results— A U-shaped relationship was found between baseline SBP and both early death and late death or dependency: early death increased by 17.9% for every 10 mm Hg below 150 mm Hg (P<0.0001) and by 3.8% for every 10 mm Hg above 150 mm Hg (P=0.016). The rate of recurrent ischemic stroke within 14 days increased by 4.2% for every 10–mm Hg increase in SBP (P=0.023); this association was present in both fatal and nonfatal recurrence. Death resulting from presumed cerebral edema was independently associated with high SBP (P=0.004). No relationship between symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and SBP was seen. Low SBP was associated with a severe clinical stroke (total anterior circulation syndrome) and an excess of deaths from coronary heart disease (P=0.002). Conclusions— Both high blood pressure and low blood pressure were independent prognostic factors for poor outcome, relationships that appear to be mediated in part by increased rates of early recurrence and death resulting from presumed cerebral edema in patients with high blood pressure and increased coronary heart disease events in those with low blood pressure. The occurrence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 14 days was independent of SBP."
4,10.1161/01.str.0000116869.64771.5a,"Background— The last few years have seen a considerable increase in the amount of information available concerning blood pressure (BP) and stroke associations. This article provides an overview of published reviews of the effects on stroke seen in trials of BP-lowering drugs and compares these with the results available from cohort studies. Summary of Review— We present a review of major overviews of prospective cohort studies and an updated meta-analysis of >40 randomized controlled trials of BP lowering, which included >188 000 participants and approximately 6800 stroke events. Cohort studies now indicate that in the Asia Pacific region as well as in North America and Western Europe, each 10 mm Hg lower systolic BP is associated with a decrease in risk of approximately one third in subjects aged 60 to 79 years. The association is continuous down to levels of at least 115/75 mm Hg and is consistent across sexes, regions, and stroke subtypes and for fatal and nonfatal events. The proportional association is age dependent but is still a strong and positive association in those aged 80 years. Data from randomized controlled trials, in which mean age at event was approximately 70 years, indicate that a 10 mm Hg reduction in systolic BP is associated with a reduction in risk of stroke of approximately one third. Per mm Hg systolic BP reduction, the benefits for stroke appear similar between agents, by baseline BP levels, and whether or not individuals have a past history of cardiovascular disease. There is, however, evidence of greater benefit with a larger BP reduction. Conclusions— The epidemiologically expected benefits of BP lowering for stroke risk reduction are broadly consistent across a range of different population subgroups. There are greater benefits from larger BP reductions, and initiating and maintaining BP reduction for stroke prevention is a more important issue than choice of initial agent."
5,10.1056/nejmoa003417,"BACKGROUND Information is limited regarding the risk of cardiovascular disease in persons with high-normal blood pressure (systolic pressure of 130 to 139 mm Hg, diastolic pressure of 85 to 89 mm Hg, or both). METHODS We investigated the association between blood-pressure category at base line and the incidence of cardiovascular disease on follow-up among 6859 participants in the Framingham Heart Study who were initially free of hypertension and cardiovascular disease. RESULTS A stepwise increase in cardiovascular event rates was noted in persons with higher base-line blood-pressure categories. The 10-year cumulative incidence of cardiovascular disease in subjects 35 to 64 years of age who had high-normal blood pressure was 4 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 2 to 5 percent) for women and 8 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 6 to 10 percent) for men; in older subjects (those 65 to 90 years old), the incidence was 18 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 12 to 23 percent) for women and 25 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 17 to 34 percent) for men. As compared with optimal blood pressure, high-normal blood pressure was associated with a risk-factor–adjusted hazard ratio for cardiovascular disease of 2.5 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.6 to 4.1) in women and 1.6 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 2.2) in men. CONCLUSIONS High-normal blood pressure is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Our findings emphasize the need to determine whether lowering high-normal blood pressure can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease."

We estimated worldwide trends in mean systolic and mean diastolic blood pressure, and the prevalence of, and number of people with, raised blood pressure, defined as systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher or diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or higher. Methods For this analysis, we pooled national, subnational, or community population-based studies that had measured blood pressure in adults aged 18 years and older. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate trends from 1975 to 2015 in mean systolic and mean diastolic blood pressure, and the prevalence of raised blood pressure for 200 countries. We calculated the contributions of changes in prevalence versus population growth and ageing to the increase in the number of adults with raised blood pressure. Findings We pooled 1479 studies that had measured the blood pressures of 19·1 million adults. Global age-standardised mean systolic blood pressure in 2015 was 127·0 mm Hg (95% credible interval 125·7–128·3) in men and 122·3 mm Hg (121·0–123·6) in women; age-standardised mean diastolic blood pressure was 78·7 mm Hg (77·9–79·5) for men and 76·7 mm Hg (75·9–77·6) for women. Global age-standardised prevalence of raised blood pressure was 24·1% (21·4–27·1) in men and 20·1% (17·8–22·5) in women in 2015. Mean systolic and mean diastolic blood pressure decreased substantially from 1975 to 2015 in high-income western and Asia Pacific countries, moving these countries from having some of the highest worldwide blood pressure in 1975 to the lowest in 2015. Mean blood pressure also decreased in women in central and eastern Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, and, more recently, central Asia, Middle East, and north Africa, but the estimated trends in these super-regions had larger uncertainty than in high-income super-regions. By contrast, mean blood pressure might have increased in east and southeast Asia, south Asia, Oceania, and sub-Saharan Africa. In 2015, central and eastern Europe, sub-Saharan Africa, and south Asia had the highest blood pressure levels. Prevalence of raised blood pressure decreased in high-income and some middle-income countries; it remained unchanged elsewhere. The number of adults with raised blood pressure increased from 594 million in 1975 to 1·13 billion in 2015, with the increase largely in low-income and middle-income countries. The global increase in the number of adults with raised blood pressure is a net effect of increase due to population growth and ageing, and decrease due to declining age-specific prevalence. Interpretation During the past four decades, the highest worldwide blood pressure levels have shifted from high-income countries to low-income countries in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa due to opposite trends, while blood pressure has been persistently high in central and eastern Europe.

7,10.1038/nrn1902,"Key Points There is growing evidence that the CNS contributes to the development and maintenance of many forms of human hypertension. The disease is typically associated with an elevated sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) and is often satisfactorily controlled by sympatholytic drugs. The mechanism by which SNA elevates resting blood pressure (BP) is not completely understood, but is thought to involve a resetting of the renal barostat (relationship between BP and sodium excretion). Several subsets of sympathetic efferent regulate the circulation. The efferents that are most crucial to BP control are tonically active at rest, and their defining property is a powerful feedback inhibition of arterial baroreceptor origin (barosensitive efferents). These sympathetic efferents respond in parallel fashion to many stimuli but can also be differentially regulated according to their visceral target (for example, the heart versus the kidney). Barosensitive efferents are recruited to raise BP and cardiac output in keeping with behaviour, but their mean level of activity at rest probably has the greatest influence on the 24-h average BP level. This basal activity is generated by a network of brainstem and hypothalamic neurons that converge at several crucial nodal points — the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) and the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH). This network is regulated by somatic and visceral sensory afferents and by blood-borne factors (for example, sodium, oxygen, hormones and cytokines), osmolality and pH. These influence selected populations of neurons via circumventricular organs, transendothelial coupling or by simple diffusion. The RVLM contains adrenergic and other neurons that are the principle source of excitatory drive to the barosensitive sympathetic preganglionic neurons. These neurons have a key role in short-term BP stabilization via the baroreflex, and in coordinating the circulation with respiration. The PVH also regulates the basal activity of barosensitive sympathetic efferents via parvocellular neurons that project to the RVLM, the NTS and the spinal cord. These neurons are especially important in the context of blood volume and regulation of sodium concentrations. Sympathetic nerve hyperactivity is commonly mediated by an elevated discharge of the sympathoexcitatory neurons located in the RVLM and PVH, but the root cause of these changes can be remote. For example, increased SNA and neurogenic hypertension can be caused by dysfunction of sensory afferents, such as chemoreceptors, baroreceptors and renal afferents, inappropriately high concentrations of hormones that regulate blood volume and sodium concentration via the hypothalamus–sympathetic nervous system axis, brainstem hypoxaemia or oxidative stress due to hyperactivity of the brain renin–angiotensin system. Abstract Hypertension — the chronic elevation of blood pressure — is a major human health problem. In most cases, the root cause of the disease remains unknown, but there is mounting evidence that many forms of hypertension are initiated and maintained by an elevated sympathetic tone. This review examines how the sympathetic tone to cardiovascular organs is generated, and discusses how elevated sympathetic tone can contribute to hypertension."
8,10.1093/ajh/1.4.335,"Abstract A primary role for the kidney in the initiation and maintenance of hypertension has long been recognized, but the pathogenetic interactions among renal hemodynamics, hormonal and hereditary factors, and dietary sodium intake remain enigmatic. Reduction in filtration surface area, whether acquired in the course of intrinsic renal disease or after surgical renal ablation, leads to systemic hypertension as well as to progressive renal insufficiency, sequellae made even more severe by dietary sodium excess. Moreover, hypertension and progressive renal disease eventuate in some individuals born with a solitary kidney, as well as in those with more severe degrees of dysgenesis (ie, oligomeganephronia). Hypertension is also commonly observed in certain inbred rat strains in which filtration surface area is congenitally deficient. Based on these and other lines of evidence reviewed herein, we postulate that a renal abnormality that contributes to essential hypertension in the general population is a reduced number of nephrons. The consequences of this abnormality are limitations in the ability to excrete sodium and thus, salt-sensitive hypertension. Finally, congenital variability in filtration surface area may explain why only some, but not all, patients exposed to potentially injurious renal stimuli eventually manifest chronic nephropathy. This may also account for the susceptibility of subsets of Type I and Type II diabetics to develop overt glomerulopathy. Am J Hypertens 1988;1:335-347"

10,10.1007/s11906-020-01077-7,"Abstract Hypertension is the leading risk factor for death and disability-adjusted life-years lost globally. Despite this tremendous impact on health, blood pressure measurement and treatment are relatively new to medical practice, with widespread measurement beginning just over 100 years ago. How, in such a short time, did blood pressure become such an integral measurement in medical practice that it is now considered one of the vital signs? Key revelations through Stephen Hales and his horse experiment, Riva-Rocci's modern blood pressure cuff, Korotkoff sounds, and President Roosevelt's death set the stage for discovery. Landmark trials such as the VA Cooperative studies of the 1960s through the recent Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial and Prevention with Mediterranean Diet trials provide the foundation for modern clinical practice. An understanding of the history of hypertension can directly affect current clinical practice and offers unique insights into how the medical community has approached the management of one of the deadliest medical conditions in history.

11,10.1007/s13246-019-00813-x,"Abstract High blood pressure (BP) or hypertension is the single most crucial adjustable risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and monitoring the arterial blood pressure (ABP) is an efficient way to detect and control the prevalence of the cardiovascular health of patients. Therefore, monitoring the regulation of BP during patients’ daily life plays a critical role in the ambulatory setting and the latest mobile health technology. In recent years, many studies have been conducted to explore the feasibility and performance of such techniques in the health care system. The ultimate aim of these studies is to find and develop an alternative to conventional BP monitoring by using cuff-less, easy-to-use, fast, and cost-effective devices for controlling and lowering the physical harm of CVDs to the human body. However, most of the current studies are at the prototype phase and face a range of issues and challenges to meet clinical standards. This review focuses on the description and analysis of the latest continuous and cuff-less methods along with their key challenges and barriers. Particularly, most advanced and standard technologies including pulse transit time (PTT), ultrasound, pulse arrival time (PAT), and machine learning are investigated. The accuracy, portability, and comfort of use of these technologies, and the ability to integrate to the wearable healthcare system are discussed. Finally, the future directions for further study are suggested."
13,10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.120.16625,"Abstract High systolic blood pressure (BP) is the single leading modifiable risk factor for death worldwide. Accurate BP measurement is the cornerstone for screening, diagnosis, and management of hypertension. Inaccurate BP measurement is a leading patient safety challenge. A recent World Health Organization report has outlined the technical specifications for automated noninvasive clinical BP measurement with cuff. The report is applicable to ambulatory, home, and office devices used for clinical purposes. The report recommends that for routine clinical purposes, (1) automated devices be used, (2) an upper arm cuff be used, and (3) that only automated devices that have passed accepted international accuracy standards (eg, the International Organization for Standardization 81060-2; 2018 protocol) be used. Accurate measurement also depends on standardized patient preparation and measurement technique and a quiet, comfortable setting. The World Health Organization report provides steps for governments, manufacturers, health care providers, and their organizations that need to be taken to implement the report recommendations and to ensure accurate BP measurement for clinical purposes. Although, health and scientific organizations have had similar recommendations for many years, the World Health Organization as the leading governmental health organization globally provides a potentially synergistic nongovernment government opportunity to enhance the accuracy of clinical BP assessment.

14,10.1016/j.preghy.2018.10.008,"Abstract Objective Self monitoring of blood pressure in pregnancy is increasingly popular with both health care professionals and patients. We assessed the validity of the iHealth Track and Omron HEM-9210T automated blood pressure devices (with Bluetooth connectivity) for the use in telemonitoring of blood pressure in pregnancy. Methods In this prospective observational study, the revised 2010 International Protocol of the European Hypertension Society (EHS) was used for the validation of the two devices against auscultatory sphygmomanometry by two independent observers who took 13 same arm measurements in 33 pregnant women, of which 10 were diagnosed with preeclampsia. The measurements were alternated between the test device and a calibrated aneroid sphygmomanometer following the protocol. Both automated devices were assessed sequentially in the same women. Results In the group of 33 women, the iHealth Track passed the EHS 2010 validation criteria with 86/98/99 of 99 device-observer systolic measurement comparisons and 88/96/98 of 99 device-observer diastolic measurement comparisons within the 5/10/15 mmHg boundaries respectively. The Omron HEM-9210T passed the same criteria with 85/94/99 of 99 device-observer systolic measurement comparisons and 82/95/99 of 99 device-observer diastolic measurement comparisons. Conclusions The iHealth Track and Omron HEM-9210T automated blood pressure monitors are validated for use in pregnancy. These two devices can now be added to the short list of validated devices in pregnancy and can be used for self-measurement of blood pressure in a telemonitoring setting of pregnant patients with (a high risk of) hypertensive disease."

16,10.1109/JBHI.2016.2620995,"Abstract The year 2016 marks the 200th birth anniversary of Carl Friedrich Wilhelm Ludwig (1816-1895). As one of the most remarkable scientists, Ludwig invented the kymograph, which for the first time enabled the recording of continuous blood pressure (BP), opening the door to the modern study of physiology. Almost a century later, intraarterial BP monitoring through an arterial line has been used clinically. Subsequently, arterial tonometry and volume clamp method were developed and applied in continuous BP measurement in a noninvasive way. In the last two decades, additional efforts have been made to transform the method of unobtrusive continuous BP monitoring without the use of a cuff. This review summarizes the key milestones in continuous BP measurement; that is, kymograph, intraarterial BP monitoring, arterial tonometry, volume clamp method, and cuffless BP technologies. Our emphasis is on recent studies of unobtrusive BP measurements as well as on challenges and future directions."
17,10.5888/pcd13.150348,"Abstract Introduction Blood pressure measurement in clinical care settings seldom follows the protocol recommended by national guidelines, potentially leading to overestimates or underestimates of blood pressure control. We evaluated blood pressure measurement methods as a source of bias in determining blood pressure control among community-dwelling adults with diabetes. Methods In a community-based trial of patients with diabetes, we measured both “clinical blood pressure” (clinical BP) (taken by a community nurse or medical assistant instructed to “take the participant’s blood pressure like you do in your own clinic”) and “research blood pressure” (research BP) (research staff followed a guideline-concordant protocol). Each participant had both types of blood pressure assessment on the same day over the course of 2 hours. Results The 227 participants had a mean age of 59 years; 86% were black and 74% were women. The mean clinical BP was 5 mm Hg higher than the mean research BP for systolic blood pressure (P < .001) and 2 mm Hg higher for diastolic blood pressure (P < .001). The proportion of participants whose clinical BP was 130/80 mm Hg or higher was 8 percentage points higher than the proportion whose research BP was 130/80 mm Hg or higher (P < .001), and the proportion whose clinical BP was 140/90 mm Hg or higher was 10 percentage points higher than the proportion whose research BP was 140/90 mm Hg or higher (P < .001). Among those aged 65 years or older, the proportion whose clinical BP was 130/80 mm Hg or higher was 10 percentage points higher than proportion whose research BP was 130/80 mm Hg or higher, and the proportion whose clinical BP was 140/90 mm Hg or higher was 14 percentage points higher than the proportion whose research BP was 140/90 mm Hg or higher. Whites and smokers had the greatest risk for having a clinical BP 5 mm Hg or more higher than their research BP. Conclusion Measurement biases in clinical settings may be a component of observed poor blood pressure control rates in real-world settings."
18,10.1073/pnas.1516047113,"Significance The present work examines beliefs associated with racial bias in pain management, a critical health care domain with well-documented racial disparities. Specifically, this work reveals that a substantial number of white laypeople and medical students and residents hold false beliefs about biological differences between blacks and whites and demonstrates that these beliefs predict racial bias in pain perception and treatment recommendation accuracy. It also provides the first evidence that racial bias in pain perception is associated with racial bias in pain treatment recommendations. Taken together, this work provides evidence that false beliefs about biological differences between blacks and whites continue to shape the way we perceive and treat black people—they are associated with racial disparities in pain assessment and treatment recommendations. Abstract Black Americans are systematically undertreated for pain relative to white Americans. We examine whether this racial bias is related to false beliefs about biological differences between blacks and whites (e.g., “black people’s skin is thicker than white people’s skin”). Study 1 documented these beliefs among white laypersons and revealed that participants who more strongly endorsed false beliefs about biological differences reported lower pain ratings for a black (vs. white) target. Study 2 extended these findings to the medical context and found that half of a sample of white medical students and residents endorsed these beliefs. Moreover, participants who endorsed these beliefs rated the black (vs. white) patient’s pain as lower and made less accurate treatment recommendations. Participants who did not endorse these beliefs rated the black (vs. white) patient’s pain as higher, but showed no bias in treatment recommendations. These findings suggest that individuals with at least some medical training hold and may use false beliefs about biological differences between blacks and whites to inform medical judgments, which may contribute to racial disparities in pain assessment and treatment."
19,10.1016/j.ajem.2019.06.014,"Abstract Objective: This review aims to quantify the effect of minority status on analgesia use for acute pain management in US Emergency Department (ED) settings. Methods: We used the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) methodology to perform a review of studies from 1990 to 2018 comparing racial and ethnic differences in the administration of analgesia for acute pain. Studies were included if they measured analgesia use in white patients compared to a racial minority in the ED and studies were excluded if they focused primarily on chronic pain, case reports and survey studies. Following data abstraction, a meta-analysis was performed using fixed and random-effect models to determine primary outcome of analgesia administration stratified by racial and ethnic classification. Results: 763 articles were screened for eligibility and fourteen studies met inclusion criteria for qualitative synthesis. The total study population included 7070 non-Hispanic White patients, 1538 Hispanic, 3125 Black, and 50.3% female. Black patients were less likely than white to receive analgesia for acute pain: OR 0.60 [95%-CI, 0.43-0.83, random effects model]. Hispanics were also less likely to receive analgesia: OR 0.75 [95%-CI, 0.52-1.09]. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the presence of racial disparities in analgesia use for the management of acute pain in US EDs.

20,10.1001/jamainternmed.2022.1903,"Assessment of blood oxygen saturation is an important measure of health on which many diagnostic and treatment decisions are based. Blood oxygen saturation is most commonly assessed via pulse oximetry, with increasing use across the home, clinic, and hospital settings during the COVID-19 pandemic.1 However, inaccuracies in pulse oximetry measurement have come under scientific scrutiny over the past 2 years.2-6 Professional organizations, lawmakers, and the public have actively engaged with the issue.4 A known design flaw of the pulse oximeter is that patients with darker skin (compared with lighter skin) are more likely to experience occult hypoxemia—defined conceptually as substantial arterial hypoxemia (SaO2) detected on blood gas but not noted on simultaneous pulse oximetry (SpO2).1 Less is known about whether underdiagnosis of hypoxemia for historically marginalized racial and ethnic groups has consequences. In their article “Racial and Ethnic Discrepancy in Pulse Oximetry and Delayed Identification of Treatment Eligibility Among Patients With COVID-19,” Dr Fawzy and colleagues evaluate this measurement bias in pulse oximetry among a population of hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19.7 The authors show measurement bias was associated with differences in delay in recognizing patients’ eligibility for COVID-19 treatment, with racial and ethnic minoritized groups being more affected. Although less visible, this is similar to the ways in which race- and ethnicity-based cutoffs in pulmonary function tests and estimated glomerular filtration fraction8 lead to underestimation of disease severity among patients of racial and ethnic minoritized groups, which in turn delays treatment of severe lung disease and limits access to timely kidney replacement therapy, including transplantation. The study by Dr Fawzy and colleagues was a retrospective analysis using a large database from 5 well-resourced hospitals.7 As in other investigations of pulse oximetry, the authors evaluated clinical SaO2 and SpO2 measurements within 10 minutes of each other, a design that allows for head-to-head comparison of pulse oximetry estimations of arterial oxygenation with the gold standard from blood gas analysis. Using race and ethnicity as a proxy for skin color, the authors chose to aggregate the data for Black−Hispanic patients and Black patients into a single study group. Dr Fawzy and colleagues reported higher rates of occult hypoxemia (SaO2 <88% when SpO2 was 92%-96%) for Asian, Black, and Hispanic patients compared with non-Hispanic White patients, as well as delayed or unrecognized eligibility for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guideline-concordant COVID-19 treatments (eg, steroids, remdesivir) for Black and Hispanic patients.7 Using underdetection of a treatment threshold to assess the consequences of undetected hypoxemia was a novel and key feature of this study. Remdesivir has US Food and Drug Administration approved use for patients whose SpO2 level is less than 94%, and dexamethasone is only recommended for patients with COVID-19 who are receiving supplemental oxygen. These findings suggest that underdetection of even mild hypoxemia can delay guideline-appropriate care. Increased mortality and/or differential mortality in patients of racial and ethnic minoritized groups has been demonstrated in studies of acute respiratory distress syndrome,9 a condition defined by arterial hypoxemia and for which treatment decisions frequently are based on pulse oximetry. Racial and ethnic discrepancy in the accuracy of commonly used pulse oximetry might play an important role in the outcome disparities described in the pulmonary literature. A recent investigation by Wong and colleagues3 similarly demonstrated consequences of underdetection of hypoxemia among a population of patients with respiratory disease. In this multicenter, retrospective, cross-sectional study using data from 3 publicly available databases that included 215 hospitals and 382 intensive care units, the authors associated higher odds of hospital mortality, elevated lactate, and high sequential organ failure assessment scores with a higher prevalence of occult hypoxemia among Asian, Black, and Hispanic patients compared with White patients. The outcome of interest (occult hypoxemia) was defined differently than in Dr Fawzy and colleagues’ study (ie, SaO2 < 88% when SpO2 > 88%), yet both studies showed that underdetected arterial hypoxemia was harmful and more frequently encountered in patients of racial and ethnic minoritized groups. Based on prior investigations and the most recent studies on pulse oximetry, 2 questions stand: (1) Why has this racial and ethnic discrepancy in the accuracy of commonly used pulse oximetry not been addressed? (2) How should clinicians respond given the increased awareness of the problem and some of its ramifications? Historical neglect of patients of racial and ethnic minoritized groups and a diminished concern for their health outcomes may explain in part why this phenomenon—differential pulse oximetry accuracy—has been recognized for more than 30 years10 and has not been corrected. Using White patients as the standard in biomedical design has led to both differential care and innovation inertia for optimizing the way devices and algorithms work for patients of racial and ethnic minoritized groups.11 The economics associated with ignoring the issue cannot be excluded from this discussion. Hospitals and practitioners continue to buy and use these devices despite their inaccuracy for non-White patients. The observation that designing a new device and exchanging millions of machines in hospitals and clinics across the country may be deemed unpopular could suggest that racial equity in patient care is not something these institutions are willing to pay for—or at least not enough of a priority to insist on devices that work equitably. Similarly, changing this injustice paradigm presents a challenge for clinicians, in part because of the passivity of medical education—students of medicine are taught how the system works, not how to change it.12 There is no single easy solution to the problem of pulse oximetry’s racial and ethnic bias. Although an easy bedside adjustment for the measurement disparity is an attractive idea, there is no proven approach because of the noise and variable bias of the currently available devices. Interestingly, the design flaws of the pulse oximeter have been corrected in some devices. These improved devices use more wave lengths of light and perform equally for different skin tones; they have been used in limited settings but have not been widely produced or distributed.1 The next generation of oxygen monitors should be designed and tested to work equally on all patients. However, this is an unlikely scenario without market pressure. Hospital systems, medical practitioners, and regulatory entities need to press for regulatory scrutiny and design equity by limiting purchasing choices to devices with equal performance for patients of all skin tones. In the meantime, a clinical strategy for avoiding undertreating hypoxia in patients with darker skin is, unfortunately, lowering the threshold for suspected disease and obtaining more arterial blood gases. Ultimately, pulse oximetry is a (flawed) measure of blood arterial saturation, which is connected to tissue hypoxia through oxygen delivery and uptake. There are multiple clinical trends that can be used to globally assess tissue hypoxia in patients with an array of illnesses. Increasing invasive testing, such as arterial blood gases, puts patients of racial and ethnic minoritized groups at higher risk of rare but possible complications, as well as physical pain, but these need to be balanced against the risks of hypoxemia, which are not uncommon. Although differences in pulse oximetry may seem to be most meaningful near treatment thresholds, certain patient populations (ie, Black patients undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for acute respiratory distress syndrome) have high rates of occult hypoxemia,4 indicating a need for greater awareness when treating these groups. Moreover, with children, even mild occult hypoxemia can have substantial long-term effects.5 Why tolerate a device that consistently works less well in patients with darker skin tones? Additionally, the association of underdetection of occult hypoxemia with treatment delay cannot be disassociated from the multilevel injustices and persistent disparities underlying the worse COVID-19 outcomes experienced by patients of racial and ethnic minoritized groups. These larger and systemic issues exist outside of device design issues demonstrated by these investigations.7Although the device measurement error is real and based purely on optics, the decision to do nothing about a faulty device is a human one, and one that can and should be corrected."

We show that a widely used algorithm, typical of this industry-wide approach and affecting millions of patients, exhibits significant racial bias: At a given risk score, Black patients are considerably sicker than White patients, as evidenced by signs of uncontrolled illnesses. Remedying this disparity would increase the percentage of Black patients receiving additional help from 17.7 to 46.5%. The bias arises because the algorithm predicts health care costs rather than illness, but unequal access to care means that we spend less money caring for Black patients than for White patients. Thus, despite health care cost appearing to be an effective proxy for health by some measures of predictive accuracy, large racial biases arise. We suggest that the choice of convenient, seemingly effective proxies for ground truth can be an important source of algorithmic bias in many contexts."

24,10.1186/s13054-018-2171-1,"Measurement of arterial pressure is one of the most basic elements of patient management. Arterial pressure is determined by the volume ejected by the heart into the arteries, the elastance of the walls of the arteries, and the rate at which the blood flows out of the arteries. This review will discuss the three forces that determine the pressure in a vessel: elastic, kinetic, and gravitational energy. Emphasis will be placed on the importance of the distribution of arterial resistances, the elastance of the walls of the large vessels, and critical closing pressures in small arteries and arterioles. Regulation of arterial pressure occurs through changes in cardiac output and changes in vascular resistance, but these two controlled variables can sometimes be in conflict."
27,,"Assessing the pulse is a common procedure and an important aspect of many nursing interventions; it should always be done with care and reassessed as needed. Assessment should always be taken seriously, with any deviations from the norm reported to a senior clinician, and pulse rate, rhythm and strength must always be documented. Pulses indicate numerous patient characteristics including the degree of relaxation, regularity of cardiac contractions and sufficiency of cardiac output. This article considers the relevant anatomy, physiology and practice of pulse assessment and recording."
31,,"Vital signs are an objective measurement of the essential physiological functions of a living organism. They have the name ""vital"" as their measurement and assessment is the critical first step for any clinical evaluation. The first set of clinical examinations is an evaluation of the vital signs of the patient. Triage of patients in an urgent/prompt care or an emergency department is based on their vital signs as it tells the physician the degree of derangement that is happening from the baseline. Healthcare providers must understand the various physiologic and pathologic processes affecting these sets of measurements and their proper interpretation. If we use a triage method where we select patients without determining their vital signs, it may not give us a reflection of the urgency of the patient's presentation.[1] The degree of vital sign abnormalities may also predict the long-term patient health outcomes, return emergency department visits, and frequency of readmission to hospitals, and utilization of healthcare resources. Traditionally, the vital signs consist of temperature, pulse rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate. Even though there are a variety of parameters that may be useful along with the traditional four vital sign parameters, studies have only found pulse oximetry and smoking status to have significance in patient outcomes.[2] Pulse oximetry sometimes helps to clarify the patient's physiological functions, which would sometimes be unclear by checking just the traditional vital signs. The inclusion of smoking status has the premise that the patient will be provided counseling by the provider on quitting smoking. In the past, some health care systems in the United States had used ""pain as the fifth vital sign'. This approach is being abandoned due to the unintended opioid crisis that the country is currently facing.[3]"
33,10.1016/S0895-7061(97)00311-7,"Pathophysiologic changes in the blood vessels are associated with a wide variety of cardiovascular events, but our ability to assess vascular structure and function are limited. Although arteriography provides some information regarding intimal pathology, it provides little information about the structure of the arterial wall or its physiology. A reduction in arterial compliance has long been regarded as a potentially useful indicator of the presence of arterial disease.1 Changes in the arterial wall leading to reductions in arterial compliance may precede the onset of clinically apparent disease, and may identify individuals at risk before disease onset (symptoms due to disease are, in general, late manifestations of alterations in organ function). The ability to predict alterations in vascular structure and function before the onset of clinical diseases such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus has potential advantages. Whether reduced vascular compliance precedes the development of cardiovascular disease (ie, is a risk factor) or is the consequence of established cardiovascular disease (ie, a marker) is a matter of debate. To qualify as a risk factor the presence of a condition must increase the probability of disease compared to those without the condition (implying stronger causality). Recent studies have suggested that the ascending aorta of the aortic trunk in Chinese has a larger diameter and thinner media than that in Australians and population differences such as these may be genetically determined.2 Studies have suggested that the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) gene is involved in the development of aortic stiffness.3 A conceptual example where abnormalities in vascular compliance might be both a risk factor and a marker is hypertension. Hypertension may alter arterial wall tone and structure increasing blood pressure, which results in a decrease in compliance (ie, the decrease in compliance is a marker for hypertension). Alternatively, when sclerotic changes occur in vessels arising from diseases that may or may not increase blood pressure, decreased compliance becomes a risk factor for the development of hypertension. In the following discussions, it should be kept in mind that there is both morphologic (structural) and functional heterogeneity in the different vascular beds. Also, there is no accepted “gold standard” methodology for estimating vascular compliance, so comparison of results obtained with differing methodologies is difficult if not impossible."

It has long been known that animals may survive the excision of both adrenal glands for one to three days or even longer, and that a low blood-pressure is found previous to the death of the animal, but the time at which such blood-pressure changes develop has not been so carefully investigated. Hoskins and McClure have shown that no fall of blood-pressure is observed in half-an-hour after the removal of the adrenals, and Young and Lehmann found no change of pressure for some hours. The evidence in this direction seems, therefore, to be mainly negative."
35,10.1016/0002-9343(81)90827-5,"Blood pressure and components of blood viscosity were measured in 49 normal subjects and in 49 untreated patients with essential hypertension. Blood viscosity values measured at six different shear rates were significantly correlated with blood pressure (r = 0.432 to 0.505, p less than 0.001). Blood viscosity was higher in hypertensive patients. This was due to both higher plasma viscosity (1.29 +/- 0.08 standard deviation versus 1.24 +/- 0.05 centipoise (cPs), p less than 0.001) and increased hematocrit values (44.4 +/- 4 percent versus 41.5 +/- 3 percent, p less than 0.005). When blood viscosity was evaluated in subgroups of normal and hypertensive subjects with matched hematocrit values, it remained higher in the hypertensive patients, and the relationship between blood pressure and viscosity was still significant. Regardless of the hematocrit value, fibrinogen levels were elevated in hypertensive patients (p less than 0.006) and, in association with the increased globulin concentration, fibrinogen was largely responsible for the increased plasma viscosity in hypertensive patients. Since the viscosity of defibrinated blood was similar in normal and hypertensive subjects with matched hematocrit values, the elevated fibrinogen level also affected whole blood viscosity. Defibrinated blood viscosity and arterial pressures were not correlated. These studies demonstrate a direct correlation between blood pressure and blood viscosity among normotensive and hypertensive subjects. This relationship is, in part, due to the rheologic effects of an elevated fibrinogen level and to an increased hematocrit value. The basis for hyperfibrinogenemia in hypertensive patients is unclear."

38,10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.107.730366,"Background: A large number of studies have examined the tracking of blood pressure (BP) from childhood to adulthood, but the reported findings are inconsistent and few systematic analyses have been conducted. Methods and results: We conducted a systematic search of PubMed for studies that examined the tracking of BP from childhood to adulthood published between January 1970 and July 2006. From 301 retrieved papers, 50 cohort studies met our inclusion criteria and provided 617 data points (Pearson/Spearman correlation coefficients) for systolic BP (SBP) and 547 data points for diastolic BP (DBP) for our meta-analysis. Information on sample characteristics and BP measurement protocols was extracted. Fisher z transformation and random-effects meta-regression analysis were conducted. The reported BP tracking correlation coefficients varied from -0.12 to 0.80 for SBP and from -0.16 to 0.70 for DBP, with an average of 0.38 for SBP and 0.28 for DBP. BP tracking varied significantly by baseline age and length of follow-up. The strength of BP tracking increased with baseline age by 0.012 for SBP (P<0.001) and 0.009 for DBP (P<0.001) and decreased with follow-up length by 0.008 for SBP (P<0.001) and 0.005 for DBP (P<0.001). BP tracking did not vary markedly across the number of BP measurements or race/population groups. Conclusions: Data from diverse populations show that the evidence for BP tracking from childhood into adulthood is strong. Childhood BP is associated with BP in later life, and early intervention is important."

43,10.3345/cep.2021.00143,"A mercury sphygmomanometer (MS) has been the gold standard for pediatric blood pressure (BP) measurements, and diagnosing hypertension is critical. However, because of environmental issues, other alternatives are needed. Noninvasive BP measurement devices are largely divided into auscultatory and oscillometric types. The aneroid sphygmomanometer, the currently used auscultatory method, is inferior to MS in terms of limitations such as validation and regular calibration and difficult to apply to infants, in whom Korotkoff sounds are not audible. The oscillometric method uses an automatic device that eliminates errors caused by human observers and has the advantage of being easy to use; however, owing to its measurement accuracy issues, the development of an international validation protocol for children is important. The hybrid method, which combines the auscultatory and electronic methods, solves some of these problems by eliminating the observer bias of terminal digit preference while maintaining measurement accuracy; however, the auscultatory method remains limited. As the age-related characteristics of the pediatric group are heterogeneous, it is necessary to reconsider the appropriate BP measurement method suitable for this indication. In addition, the mobile application-based BP measurement market is growing rapidly with the development of smartphone applications. Although more research is still needed on their accuracy, many experts expect that mobile application-based BP measurement will effectively reduce medical costs due to increased ease of access and early BP management."
44,10.1097/00126097-200104000-00006,"Background: Aneroid manometers are frequently used to measure blood pressure. Aneroid manometers have moving parts that are subject to fatigue. The accuracy duration of the aneroid devices, like most digital devices, is unstudied. It has been accepted that if the aneroid device does not rest at '0' it is inaccurate, but how often is the device inaccurate when it does rest at '0'? Methods: A Universal Biometer DPM-III measuring unit was used for all of the measurements at 10 University of Michigan Health System sites. A total of 136 aneroid manometers were tested. Two additional aneroid devices were not tested, as the needle did not start within '0'. Static pressure measurements were made at nine levels for all devices: 50, 80, 90, 100, 120, 150, 200 and 250mmHg. Results: The average difference of the nine pressure settings of the whole group was 0.2+/-0.31 (95% confidence interval 0.1-0.2) mmHg. The largest number of devices that were not calibrated within +/-3mmHg was seen at the 150mmHg setting with six (4.4%) of the devices failing. If an accuracy standard of +/-2mmHg was used, the largest number of devices failed at 250mmHg (22 devices, 16.2%). The largest number of devices that were inaccurate was manufactured 6 years prior to testing and was from two sites. Conclusions: Aneroid devices were accurate. A yearly calibration programme should be performed and a +/-2mmHg standard should be used. Portable aneroid manometers may need to be more frequently calibrated due to the trauma associated with dropping."

Although the mercury sphygmomanometer is highly accurate, there are concerns about the environmental toxicity of mercury. In response to various external pressures to become essentially mercury free, the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn, has replaced many mercury sphygmomanometers with aneroid devices. Since 1993, a maintenance protocol has been in place to ensure proper function and accuracy of these devices. Methods: We assessed the accuracy of 283 aneroid devices using as the reference standard a digital pressure and vacuum meter that was calibrated using a mercury sphygmomanometer. Results: The mean +/- SD values from the aneroid device in millimeters of mercury at each reference point (at 20-mm Hg intervals from 60 to 240 mm Hg defined by the reference device) were 59.9 +/- 1.9 at 60; 79.9 +/- 1.9 at 80; 100.0 +/- 1.8 at 100; 120.3 +/- 1.8 at 120; 140.7 +/- 1.4 at 140; 160.7 +/- 1.7 at 160; 180.9 +/- 1.3 at 180; 200.7 +/- 5.0 at 200; 221.0 +/- 1.3 at 220; and 240.8 +/- 1.6 at 240 (r = 0.99; P<.001). The values from the aneroid device underestimated those of the reference device by a mean of 0.5 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, 0.3-0.7).

Measurement of accuracy of calibration and evaluation of physical conditions were carried out in 524 sphygmomanometers, 351 from a hospital setting, and 173 from private medical offices. Mercury sphygmomanometers were considered inaccurate if the meniscus was not '0' at rest. Aneroid sphygmomanometers were tested against a properly calibrated mercury manometer, and were considered calibrated when the error was < or =3 mm Hg. Both types of sphygmomanometers were evaluated for conditions of cuff/bladder, bulb, pump and valve. Of the mercury sphygmomanometers tested 21 % were found to be inaccurate. Of this group, unreliability was noted due to: excessive bouncing (14%), illegibility of the gauge (7%), blockage of the filter (6%), and lack of mercury in the reservoir (3%). Bladder damage was noted in 10% of the hospital devices and in 6% of private medical practices. Rubber aging occurred in 34% and 25%, leaks/holes in 19% and 18%, and leaks in the pump bulb in 16% and 30% of hospital devices and private practice devices, respectively. Of the aneroid sphygmomanometers tested, 44% in the hospital setting and 61% in private medical practices were found to be inaccurate. Of these, the magnitude of inaccuracy was 4-6 mm Hg in 32%, 7-12 mm Hg in 19% and > 13 mm Hg in 7%. In summary, most of the mercury and aneroid sphygmomanometers showed inaccuracy (21% vs 58%) and unreliability (64% vs 70%)."

A total of six challenges were identified: (1) existing devices do not guarantee that the recommendations are followed, (2) healthcare providers cannot verify whether self-monitoring patients follow the recommendations, (3) patients are not aware of all recommendations and the need to follow them, (4) risk of patient induced reporting bias, (5) risk of healthcare provider induced data-transfer bias, and (6) risk of data being registered as belonging to the wrong patient. We conclude that existing BPSM interventions could be significantly affected by user-induced bias resulting in an indeterminable quality of the measurement data.

The oscillometric-based automatic office blood pressure measurement (AOBPM) is widely used in hospitals and clinics, but measurement errors are common in BP measurements. There is a lack of systematic review of the sources of measurement errors.Approach: A systematic review of all existing research on sources of AOBPM errors. A search strategy was designed in six online databases, and all the literature published before October 2021 was selected. Those studies that used the AOBPM device to measure BP from the upper arm of subjects were included.Main results: A total of 1365 studies were screened, and 224 studies were included in this final review. They investigated 22 common error sources with clinical AOBPM. Regarding the causes of BP errors, this review divided them into the following categories: the activities before measurement, patient's factors, measurement environment, measurement procedure, and device settings. 13 sources caused increased systolic and diastolic BP (SBP and DBP), 2 sources caused the decrease in SBP and DBP, only 1 source had no significant effect on BPs, and the other errors had a non-uniform effect (either increase or decrease in BPs). The error ranges for SBP and DBP were -14 to 33 mmHg and -6 to 19 mmHg, respectively.Significance: The measurement accuracy of AOBPM is susceptible to the influence of measurement factors. Interpreting BP readings need to be treated with caution in clinical measurements. This review made comprehensive evidence for the need for standardized BP measurements and provided guidance for clinical practitioners when measuring BP with AOBPM devices."
56,10.1161/HYP.0000000000000087,"The accurate measurement of blood pressure (BP) is essential for the diagnosis and management of hypertension. This article provides an updated American Heart Association scientific statement on BP measurement in humans. In the office setting, many oscillometric devices have been validated that allow accurate BP measurement while reducing human errors associated with the auscultatory approach. Fully automated oscillometric devices capable of taking multiple readings even without an observer being present may provide a more accurate measurement of BP than auscultation. Studies have shown substantial differences in BP when measured outside versus in the office setting. Ambulatory BP monitoring is considered the reference standard for out-of-office BP assessment, with home BP monitoring being an alternative when ambulatory BP monitoring is not available or tolerated. Compared with their counterparts with sustained normotension (ie, nonhypertensive BP levels in and outside the office setting), it is unclear whether adults with white-coat hypertension (ie, hypertensive BP levels in the office but not outside the office) have increased cardiovascular disease risk, whereas those with masked hypertension (ie, hypertensive BP levels outside the office but not in the office) are at substantially increased risk. In addition, high nighttime BP on ambulatory BP monitoring is associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk. Both oscillometric and auscultatory methods are considered acceptable for measuring BP in children and adolescents. Regardless of the method used to measure BP, initial and ongoing training of technicians and healthcare providers and the use of validated and calibrated devices are critical for obtaining accurate BP measurements."

Methods: A systematic review of studies quantifying BP measurement inaccuracy. Medline and CINAHL databases were searched for empirical articles and systematic reviews published up to June 2015. Empirical articles were included if they reported a study that was relevant to the measurement of adult patients’ resting BP at the upper arm in a clinical setting (e.g. ward or office); identified a specific source of inaccuracy; and quantified its effect. Reference lists and reviews were searched for additional articles. Results: A total of 328 empirical studies were included. They investigated 29 potential sources of inaccuracy, categorized as relating to the patient, device, procedure or observer. Significant directional effects were found for 27; however, for some, the effects were inconsistent in direction. Compared with true resting BP, significant effects of individual sources ranged from −23.6 to +33 mmHg SBP and −14 to +23 mmHg DBP. Conclusion: A single BP value outside the expected range should be interpreted with caution and not taken as a definitive indicator of clinical deterioration. Where a measurement is abnormally high or low, further measurements should be taken and averaged. Wherever possible, BP values should be recorded graphically within ranges. This may reduce the impact of sources of inaccuracy and reduce the scope for misinterpretations based on small, likely erroneous or misleading, changes."
59,10.1007/BF01695937,"The importance of cuff deflation rate in the auscultatory method of measuring blood pressure was investigated using a computer-based model. To determine the relationship between the cuff deflation rate and the measurement error, two cuff deflation protocols were used, one based on heart rate (mm Hg per heartbeat), the other on a constant rate (mm Hg per second). The different deflation protocols and rates were tested using a constant blood pressure of 120/80 mm Hg and heart rates ranging from 40 to 120 beats/min. It was confirmed that a cuff deflation rate that is time based will introduce larger errors at low heart rates. Using heart rate as a basis for cuff deflation rate yields a constant error that is independent of heart rate. The currently used standard of 3 mm Hg/s could result in a maximum error of 2.5 mm Hg in both systolic and diastolic pressures at a heart rate of 72 beats/min. The maximum systolic and diastolic errors increase to more than 4 mm Hg at 40 beats/min. A deflation rate of 2 mm Hg/beat, however, yields a maximum error of 2 mm Hg for both systolic and diastolic pressures, independent of heart rate. A cuff deflation rate based on heart rate is recommended to help minimize changes in measurement error when measuring blood pressure if a wide range of heart rates will be encountered."
60,- missing - PMID: 17925905,"Background: Hypertension is the most commonly managed problem in general practice. Systematic errors in blood pressure measurements caused by inadequate sphygmomanometer calibration are a common cause of over- and underidentification of hypertension. Objective: This article reviews sphygmomanometer error and makes recommendations regarding in service maintenance and calibration of sphygmomanometers. Discussion: Most sphygmomanometer surveys report high rates of inadequate calibration and other faults, particularly in aneroid sphygmomanometers. Automatic electronic sphygmomanometers produce systematic errors in some patients. All sphygmomanometers should be checked and calibrated by an accredited laboratory at least annually. Aneroid sphygmomanometers should be calibrated every 6 months. Only properly validated automatic sphygmomanometers should be used. Practices should perform regular in house checks of sphygmomanometers. Good sphygmomanometer maintenance and traceable sphygmomanometer calibration will contribute to reducing the burden of cardiovascular disease and the number of patients overtreated for hypertension in Australia."

Methods: We fitted regression curves to distributions of diastolic and systolic BP from recent Canadian and UK surveys and calculated the effect of systematic measurement errors on changes in the numbers of patients who would be classified hypertensive at thresholds of 85, 90 and 95 mmHg diastolic and 140 and 160 mmHg systolic pressure respectively. Results: Overestimation of diastolic BP by 5 mmHg increases the number of patients whose diastolic BP exceeds 85, 90 and 95 mmHg by 102, 132 and 166% respectively. Equivalent underestimation causes 57, 62 and 67% respectively of hypertensive patients to be missed. If systematic error in diastolic pressure is limited to +/-1 mmHg the diagnosis errors are between -15 and +23%. Overestimation of systolic BP by 3 and 5 mmHg increases the number classified as hypertensive by 24 and 43% respectively. Equivalent underestimation causes 19 and 30% of patients with systolic hypertension to be missed. Conclusions: Small systematic errors in BP measurements may cause large variations in the proportion of patients diagnosed as hypertensive. To limit over- or under-diagnosis of diastolic hypertension to approximately 20%, systematic errors in diastolic BP measurements should be limited to 1 mmHg. An uncertainty of 3 mmHg may be adequate for detecting systolic hypertension."

Methods: Purposive sampling method was used in this cross-sectional descriptive study. The study sample comprised 541 healthcare professionals. The data were collected using personal information form and 'Medical Device Calibration Information Form'. Results: 72.2% of participants did not receive training on calibration, 40.5% indicated that they had no information about the presence of uncalibrated equipment in their units, and 14.3% reported uncalibrated devices in their units. Total knowledge scores of female participants or those at the age of 35 and older, and doctors or laborants were determined to be significantly higher than the other participants (p <0.05). Conclusions: It was determined that healthcare professionals had a low level of knowledge about calibration, used non-calibrated medical devices, and did not receive training on calibration. It is recommended that calibration should be introduced as a subject in both the university curriculum and in-service training programs for healthcare professionals."
63,10.1161/01.CIR.0000154900.76284.F6,"Accurate measurement of blood pressure is essential to classify individuals, to ascertain blood pressure-related risk, and to guide management. The auscultatory technique with a trained observer and mercury sphygmomanometer continues to be the method of choice for measurement in the office, using the first and fifth phases of the Korotkoff sounds, including in pregnant women. The use of mercury is declining, and alternatives are needed. Aneroid devices are suitable, but they require frequent calibration. Hybrid devices that use electronic transducers instead of mercury have promise. The oscillometric method can be used for office measurement, but only devices independently validated according to standard protocols should be used, and individual calibration is recommended. They have the advantage of being able to take multiple measurements. Proper training of observers, positioning of the patient, and selection of cuff size are all essential. It is increasingly recognized that office measurements correlate poorly with blood pressure measured in other settings, and that they can be supplemented by self-measured readings taken with validated devices at home. There is increasing evidence that home readings predict cardiovascular events and are particularly useful for monitoring the effects of treatment. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory monitoring gives a better prediction of risk than office measurements and is useful for diagnosing white-coat hypertension. There is increasing evidence that a failure of blood pressure to fall during the night may be associated with increased risk. In obese patients and children, the use of an appropriate cuff size is of paramount importance."

65,10.1186/2042-6410-3-7,"Men have higher blood pressure than women through much of life regardless of race and ethnicity. This is a robust and highly conserved sex difference that it is also observed across species including dogs, rats, mice and chickens and it is found in induced, genetic and transgenic animal models of hypertension. Not only do the differences between the ovarian and testicular hormonal milieu contribute to this sexual dimorphism in blood pressure, the sex chromosomes also play a role in and of themselves. This review primarily focuses on epidemiological studies of blood pressure in men and women and experimental models of hypertension in both sexes. Gaps in current knowledge regarding what underlie male-female differences in blood pressure control are discussed. Elucidating the mechanisms underlying sex differences in hypertension may lead to the development of anti-hypertensives tailored to one's sex and ultimately to improved therapeutic strategies for treating this disease and preventing its devastating consequences."
66,10.1161/01.hyp.37.5.1199,"Men are at greater risk for cardiovascular and renal disease than are age-matched, premenopausal women. Recent studies using the technique of 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring have shown that blood pressure is higher in men than in women at similar ages. After menopause, however, blood pressure increases in women to levels even higher than in men. Hormone replacement therapy in most cases does not significantly reduce blood pressure in postmenopausal women, suggesting that the loss of estrogens may not be the only component involved in the higher blood pressure in women after menopause. In contrast, androgens may decrease only slightly, if at all, in postmenopausal women. In this review the possible mechanisms by which androgens may increase blood pressure are discussed. Findings in animal studies show that there is a blunting of the pressure-natriuresis relationship in male spontaneously hypertensive rats and in ovariectomized female spontaneously hypertensive rats treated chronically with testosterone. The key factor in controlling the pressure-natriuresis relationship is the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). The possibility that androgens increase blood pressure via the RAS is explored, and the possibility that the RAS also promotes oxidative stress leading to production of vasoconstrictor substances and reduction in nitric oxide availability is proposed."
67,10.1001/jamacardio.2019.5306,"Importance: If we assume that women and men exhibit variations of the same fundamental vascular physiology, then conventional analyses of subclinical measures would suggest that women catch up to men by midlife in the extent of potentially important vascular disease. Alternatively, under the assumption that vascular physiology may fundamentally differ between women and men, a sex-specific analysis of existing data could offer new insights and augment our understanding of sex differences in cardiovascular diseases. Objective: To evaluate whether longitudinal patterns of blood pressure (BP) elevation differ between women and men during the life course when considering baseline BP levels as the reference. Design, setting, and participants: We conducted sex-specific analyses of longitudinal BP measures (144 599 observations) collected for a period of 43 years (1971 to 2014) in 4 community-based US cohort studies. The combined total included 32 833 participants (54% female) spanning ages 5 to 98 years. Data were analyzed between May 4, 2019, and August 5, 2019. Exposures: Age and serially assessed longitudinal BP measures: systolic BP, diastolic BP, mean arterial pressure (MAP), and pulse pressure (PP). Main outcomes and measures: Sex-specific change in each primary BP measure compared with baseline BP levels, derived from multilevel longitudinal models fitted over the age span, and new-onset cardiovascular disease events. Results: Of the 32 833 participants, 17 733 were women (54%). Women compared with men exhibited a steeper increase in BP that began as early as in the third decade and continued through the life course (likelihood ratio test χ2 = 531 for systolic BP; χ2 = 123 for diastolic BP; χ2 = 325 for MAP; and χ2 = 572 for PP; P for all <.001). After adjustment for multiple cardiovascular disease risk factors, these between-sex differences in all BP trajectories persisted (likelihood ratio test χ2 = 314 for systolic BP; χ2 = 31 for diastolic BP; χ2 = 129 for MAP; and χ2 = 485 for PP; P for all <.001). Conclusions and relevance: In contrast with the notion that important vascular disease processes in women lag behind men by 10 to 20 years, sex-specific analyses indicate that BP measures actually progress more rapidly in women than in men, beginning early in life. This early-onset sexual dimorphism may set the stage for later-life cardiovascular diseases that tend to present differently, not simply later, in women compared with men."
68,10.1093/ajh/hpx173,"Background: This work aimed to explore whether different forms of a simple isometric exercise test could be used to predict the blood pressure (BP)-lowering efficacy of different types of isometric resistance training (IRT) in healthy young adults. In light of the emphasis on primary prevention of hypertension, identifying those with normal BP who will respond to IRT is important. Also, heightened BP reactivity increases hypertension risk, and as IRT reduces BP reactivity in patients with hypertension, it warrants further investigation in a healthy population. Methods: Forty-six young men and women (24 ± 5 years; 116 ± 10/ 68 ± 8 mm Hg) were recruited from 2 study sites: Windsor, Canada (n = 26; 13 women), and Northampton, United Kingdom (n = 20; 10 women). Resting BP and BP reactivity to an isometric exercise test were assessed prior to and following 10 weeks of thrice weekly IRT. Canadian participants trained on a handgrip dynamometer (isometric handgrip, IHG), while participants in the UK trained on an isometric leg extension dynamometer (ILE). Results: Men and women enrolled in both interventions demonstrated significant reductions in systolic BP (P < 0.001) and pulse pressure (P < 0.05). Additionally, test-induced systolic BP changes to IHG and ILE tests were associated with IHG and ILE training-induced reductions in systolic BP after 10 weeks of training, respectively (r = 0.58 and r = 0.77; for IHG and ILE; P < 0.05). Conclusions: The acute BP response to an isometric exercise test appears to be a viable tool to identify individuals who may respond to traditional IRT prescription."
69,- missing - PMID: 22314980,"Evidence exists that women have lower orthostatic tolerance than men during quiescent standing. Water ingestion has been demonstrated to improve orthostatic tolerance in patients with severe autonomic dysfunction. We therefore sought to test the hypothesis that water ingestion would improve orthostatic tolerance in healthy young women more than in aged-matched men. Thirty seven (22 men and 15 women) healthy subjects aged 22.5± 1.7 and 21.5±1.4 (means±SD) respectively, ingested 50ml (control) and 500ml of water 40min before orthostatic challenge on two separate days of appointment in a randomized controlled, cross-over design. Seated and standing blood pressure and heart rate were determined. Orthostatic tolerance was assessed as the time to presyncope during standing. Ingesting 500ml of water significantly improves orthostatic tolerance by 22% (32.0 ± 5.2 vs 26.2 ± 2.4min; p< 0.05) in men and by 33% (24.2±2.8 vs 18.3 ± 3.2; p< 0.05) in women. Thirty minutes after ingesting 500ml of water, seated systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, pulse pressure and mean arterial pressure rose significantly in men while only systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure rose significantly in women. However ingesting 500ml of water did not have significant effect on seated heart rate in both men and women. Ingestion of 500ml of water significantly attenuated both the orthostatic challenge-induced increased heart rate and decreased pulse pressure responses especially in women. Diastolic blood pressure tended to be positively correlated with orthostatic tolerance strongly in men than in women. Pulse pressure correlated positively while heart rate correlated negatively to orthostatic tolerance in women but not in men independent of other correlates. Water ingestion is associated with orthostatic tolerance strongly in women but weakly in men independent of other correlates. In conclusion, the findings in the present study demonstrated that water ingestion caused improvement strongly in young women than in young men. This improvement is associated with increased pulse pressure and decreased tachycardiac responses during orthostatic challenge."

This study was aimed to examine the acute effect of tobacco and non-tobacco cigarette smoking on the blood pressure and heart rate by randomized crossover study. In the results, systolic/diastolic blood pressure and heart rate changes after smoking were significantly different between male and female group. Blood pressure and heart rate were elevated after smoking, but statistical significance for the difference was identified only in the female group. Because Non-tobacco smoke made from leaves of E. ulmoides has no nicotine, its effect on blood pressure and heart rate was negligible. Remarkable difference of heart rate changes in women was observed between tobacco cigarette smoking group and non-tobacco cigarette smoking group."
71,10.1186/s12937-016-0146-0,"Background: It has been suggested that coffee may affect the gut-brain axis with conflicting outcomes. Moreover, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether the type or temperature of coffee consumed will have a different impact on the gut-brain axis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of acute coffee consumption on the following: 1. self-reported GI symptoms and salivary gastrin, 2. stress indices [salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase (sAA)] and psychometric measures, and 3. blood pressure (BP), in healthy, daily coffee consuming individuals in non-stressful conditions. Methods: This was a randomized, double blind, crossover clinical trial, in which 40 healthy individuals (20 men, 20 women), 20-55 years of age, randomly consumed four 200 ml coffee beverages containing 160 mg caffeine (hot and cold instant coffee, cold espresso, hot filtered coffee), 1 week apart. Salivary samples and psychometric questionnaires were collected at baseline and post-coffee consumption at 15,30, and 60 min for salivary gastrin and sAA measurements and at 60,120, and 180 min for cortisol measurements. BP was measured at beginning and end of each intervention. ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02253628 RESULTS: Coffee consumption significantly increased sAA activity (P = 0.041), with significant differences only between cold instant and filter coffee at 15 and 30 min post-consumption (P < 0.05). Coffee temporarily increased salivary gastrin, without differences between coffee types. Coffee did not affect salivary cortisol or self-reported anxiety levels. Coffee consumption significantly increased BP, within the healthy physiological levels, in a gender specific manner at the end of the experimental periods, without differences between coffee types. Conclusion: Acute coffee consumption in non-stressful conditions activated sAA and BP but not salivary cortisol, indicating activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Post-coffee sAA increase without a concomitant cortisol increase may also indicate that coffee may have some anti-stress properties."

We aimed to determine in healthy adults the effect of water on cardiac workload and to investigate potential gender differences. We pooled data from two controlled studies where blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were continuously recorded before and after the ingestion of 355 mL of tap water. Additionally, we calculated double product by multiplying systolic BP with HR and evaluated spectral parameters referring to vagal tone. All parameters were investigated for potential differences based on gender. In response to water, HR, systolic BP, and double product decreased significantly during the first 30 min. However, these effects were attenuated for HR and double product and even abolished for systolic BP over the subsequent 30 min. Over the entire post-drink period (60 min), decreases in HR and double product (all P < 0.05) were observed. Spectral markers for vagal tone increased with the on-set of the water drink and remained elevated until the end (P < 0.005). No significant gender difference in cardiac workload parameters was observed. We provide evidence that drinking water decreases, in a time-dependent fashion, cardiac workload and that these responses appear not to be influenced by gender."

Twenty-nine women (mean age 19.1, range 18-29) and 26 men (mean age 19.3, range 18-25) rested for 10 min while systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressures were measured. They were then asked to complete a 2-min cold pressor task. Participants were asked to fill out the short form of the McGill Pain Questionnaire immediately after the pain task. Hierarchical regression analyses were performed to predict pain sensitivity from resting blood pressure, gender, and the interaction of resting blood pressure and gender. Resting systolic blood pressure was a significant predictor of pain sensitivity. Gender and the interaction between resting blood pressure and gender were not related to pain sensitivity. This suggests that the relation between resting blood pressure and pain sensitivity may be similar in men and women, at least in response to a cold pressor challenge."
74,10.1161/01.hyp.14.6.598,"The purpose of this study was to examine ambulatory blood pressure and heart rate patterns in healthy, normotensive adolescents and to determine the influence of race and gender on these patterns. Ambulatory blood pressure recordings were performed on 199 adolescents; 42 were black males, 55 were white males, 65 were black females, and 37 were white females. The mean age (+/- SD) was 13 +/- 2 years. Blood pressure readings were obtained with an automatic, noninvasive recorder. Black adolescents and white adolescents had similar blood pressures while awake (116/69 vs. 116/69 mm Hg), with boys having higher levels of systolic blood pressure (118 vs. 114 mm Hg) and comparable levels of diastolic blood pressure (69 vs. 69 mm Hg) relative to girls. The patterns while the adolescents were asleep, however, were different. White boys (106 mm Hg), white girls (105 mm Hg), and black girls (105 mm Hg) had similar systolic blood pressures during sleep. Black boys (112 mm Hg), however, had significantly higher systolic blood pressures while asleep. Black adolescents, as a group, had significantly higher diastolic blood pressures than white adolescents while asleep (64 vs. 61 mm Hg). Changes in blood pressure from awake to asleep were not related to changes in heart rate. Results of this study indicate that both race and gender are important determinants of the diurnal pattern of blood pressure and heart rate in adolescents."
75,10.1186/s12872-018-0855-8,"Background: Evidences suggest that central hemodynamics indexes are independent predictors of future cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. Multiple factors have been pointed to have potential influence on central aortic function: height, heart rate, left ventricular ejection duration and blood pressure level. Data related to the influence of gender and postmenopausal status on aortic waveform reflection is scarce. We aim to evaluate the impact of gender and menopause on central blood pressure of hypertensive patients. Methods: In a cross sectional study 122 hypertensive patients (52 men and 70 women) were studied. Hypertension was defined as blood pressure (BP) levels ≥140/90 mmHg or use of antihypertensive drugs. Central arterial pressure, augmentation index (AIx) and augmentation index normalized to 75 bpm (AIx75) were obtained using applanation tonometry. Menopause and postmenopause history were accessed by a direct series of questions. Postmenopause was defined as at least one year since last menstruation. Patients were paired by age, gender and menopausal status, and the data were compared considering gender and menopausal status. Results: Height and weight were significantly lower in women than in men at the same age. Conversely, AIx (32.7 ± 9.8% vs. 20.1 ± 11.7%, p < 0.01), AIx75 (29.6 ± 6.7% vs. 18.3 ± 9.4%, p < 0.01) and central systolic blood pressure (136 ± 30 vs. 125 ± 23 mmHg, p = 0.03) were higher in women than men. The menopausal women (mean age of menopause = 48 years) had the worst indexes of aortic wave reflection, compared to men at the same age and younger women. Conclusion: Hypertensive women had both higher reflected aortic pressure waveform and central blood pressure indexes than hypertensive men, and these findings were worsened by the menopausal status."
76,10.4082/kjfm.2013.34.2.145,"Background: According to the current guidelines for blood pressure monitoring, clinicians are recommended to measure blood pressure by completely exposing the upper arm. However, it is a common practice that blood pressure is measured with the cuff placed over the sleeve or with the sleeve rolled up. We therefore conducted this study to examine whether there are any differences in blood pressure measurements among the three different settings: the sleeve group, the rolled sleeve group, and the bare arm group. Methods: We conducted the current study in 141 male and female adult patients who visited our clinical department. In these patients, we took repeatedly blood pressure measurements using the same automatic oscillometric device on three different settings. Then, we analyzed the results with the use of randomized block design analysis of variance. Results: The mean values of systolic blood pressure (SBP) between the first reading and those of the second reading were 128.5 ± 10.6 mm Hg in the sleeve group, 128.3 ± 10.8 mm Hg in the rolled sleeve group, and 128.3 ± 10.7 mm Hg in the bare arm group. These results indicate that there were no significant differences among the three groups (P = 0.32). In addition, the mean values of diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between the first reading and those of the second reading were 80.7 ± 6.1 mm Hg in the sleeve group, 80.7 ± 6.1 mm Hg in the rolled sleeve group, and 80.6 ± 5.9 mm Hg in the bare arm group. These results indicate that there were no significant differences among the three groups (P = 0.77). In addition, based on the age, sex, past or current history of hypertension or diabetes mellitus, the thickness of sleeve, weight, a drinking history, and a smoking history, there were no significant differences in SBP and DBP among the three groups.
Conclusion: There were no significant differences in blood pressure measurements between the three different settings (the sleeve group, the rolled sleeve group, and the bare arm group)."
77,10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.643940,"Background: Cross-sectional studies demonstrated ethnic and gender differences in ambulatory blood pressure patterns, but little is known about the longitudinal development of these differences. Methods and results: Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure was measured up to 12 times (5 times on average) over a 15-year period in 312 African Americans (AAs) and 351 European Americans aged 7 to 30 years. Multivariate individual growth curves across age were created for daytime and nighttime blood pressure jointly. For both daytime and nighttime systolic blood pressure (SBP), AAs and males had higher levels (P<0.001) than European Americans and females. Males also showed a greater increase with age (P<0.001) than females. For nighttime SBP, a faster increase of SBP with age (P<0.01) in AAs was additionally observed. The ethnic difference in nighttime SBP levels and its increase with age were significantly larger than in daytime SBP. For daytime and nighttime diastolic blood pressure, AAs had higher levels than European Americans (P<0.001), and this difference was significantly larger at night. From late adolescence onward, males showed a greater increase in diastolic blood pressure with age than females. Ethnic and gender differences persisted after adjustment for height, body mass index, socioeconomic status, and stress-related coping styles. Family history of essential hypertension explained ethnic differences in daytime SBP. Conclusions: We observed significant ethnic and gender differences in longitudinal trajectories of ambulatory blood pressure in youth and young adults. The blunted nocturnal decline and its exacerbation with age in AAs corroborate and extend findings of cross-sectional studies."
78,10.4070/kcj.2016.46.3.374,"Background and objectives: We investigated the inter-arm difference in blood pressure of the general Korean population to identify associated factors. Subjects and methods: A total of 806 participants aged 30 to 64 years without history of major cardiovascular disease were analyzed in this cross-sectional study. They participated in the Cardiovascular and Metabolic Disease Etiology Research Center cohort study that began in 2013. Brachial blood pressure was measured simultaneously for both arms using an automated oscillometric device equipped with two cuffs in seated position. After five minutes of rest, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were measured three times. The average of the three measurements was used for analysis. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with inter-arm differences in blood pressure. Results: The mean inter-arm difference was 3.3 mmHg for SBP and 2.0 mmHg for DBP. Large inter-arm differences (≥10 mmHg) in SBP and in DBP were found in 3.7% and 0.9% of subjects, respectively. A large inter-arm difference in SBP was associated with mean SBP (p=0.002) and C-reactive protein (p=0.014) while a large inter-arm different in DBP was only associated with body mass index (p=0.015). Sex, age, and anti-hypertensive medication use were not associated with differences in inter-arm blood pressure. Conclusion: Large inter-arm difference in blood pressure is only present in a small portion of healthy Korean adults. Our findings suggest that high SBP, chronic inflammation, and obesity may be associated with larger difference in inter-arm blood pressure."

Additionally, other possible risk factors impacting BP levels in relation to patients' demographic characteristics and use of atypical antipsychotic drugs and medications to reduce blood pressure were analyzed. Methods: Using medical records, demographic data, and results of physical examination, this cross-sectional study investigated the prevalence of hypertension and high BP and its association with body weight among 1,030 inpatients with schizophrenia in a large psychiatric facility in Taiwan. Results: The prevalence of high BP and hypertension were found to be higher among inpatients with schizophrenia in Taiwan in comparison with those of the general population in line with the latest evidence. Hypertension was significantly associated with body mass index; meanwhile, other risk factors, including age, gender, length of hospital stay, time since initial schizophrenia diagnosis, medications used to reduce blood pressure, and atypical antipsychotics, were identified. However, body mass index was the most effective predictor of blood pressure in the study. Conclusion: The findings of this research shed light on the importance of developing effective weight and blood pressure monitoring and management programs for inpatients with schizophrenia. There is also a need for clinical nurses to employ multiple behavioral intervention strategies to minimize risks of high BP in patients with schizophrenia. We recommend that clinical nurses carefully monitor and control BP among inpatients with schizophrenia."

The aim of this cross-sectional study was to consider the clinical and epidemiological implications of blood pressure measured in seated versus supine position, and to investigate the impact of age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and diabetes on these differences. This study included 1298 individuals (mean age 58.6 ± 11.8 years) from the Vara-Skövde cohort at the 10 years’ follow-up visit in 2014. Physical examination included blood pressure measurements in seated and supine position. Self-reported information on diabetes status, hypertension, ongoing medication, leisure time physical activity, and smoking habits were obtained. Linear regression models accounted for differences in age, sex, BMI, and known diabetes. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure were significantly higher in the seated position [1.2 mm Hg, P < .001, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.79–1.54 and 4.2 mm Hg, P < .001, 95% CI 4.08–4.71, respectively]. The prevalence of high blood pressure in seated position was higher (19.9%) than in supine position (13.5%). Linear regression analysis showed that age (β = −0.215, P < .001) and diabetes (β = −0.072, P = .012) were associated with smaller differences in postural diastolic blood pressure and BMI (β = 0.124, P < .001) with greater difference. This study showed substantial postural differences in blood pressures measured in office. Measuring blood pressure in the supine position shows lower blood pressure readings when compared with the seated position. Clinicians should be aware of how age, BMI, and diabetes influence these differences."
81,10.1161/01.HYP.0000022693.11752.E9,"The correlations between systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and between SBP and body mass index (BMI), might result from genetic or environmental factors that determine variation in 2 or more phenotypes and are shared by family members. In 767 adult nuclear families (n=2912 individuals, including 66 pairs of monozygotic twins and 84 pairs of dizygotic twins), we used a multivariate normal model and the software FISHER to estimate genetic and environmental components of variation and covariation. Mean phenotypes were adjusted for age, gender, and generation, and for antihypertensive treatment. Genetic and shared family environmental factors accounted for 46% and 31% of total variance in SBP, respectively. Adjustment of SBP for DBP reduced considerably both the additive genetic (86.7 to 21.0) and shared environmental (59.7 to 21.0) components of variance. Smaller reductions in genetic (86.7 to 84.9) and shared environmental (59.7 to 51.1) components were observed after adjustment of SBP for BMI. For SBP and DBP, the correlation between the effects of genes was 1.00 and between shared environmental effects was 0.52. For SBP and BMI the correlations were 0.30 for genetic and 0.22 for shared environmental effects. Our findings suggest that the same genes and many of the same family environmental factors determine variation in both SBP and DBP. In contrast, SBP and BMI share genetic and family environmental determinants to a lesser degree. These observations are relevant to multifactorial cardiovascular risk reduction based on genetic and family environmental approaches."
82,10.1093/ajh/hpz096,"BACKGROUND Obesity is one of the main determinants of blood pressure. The aim of this study was to evaluate and quantify the relations between the different anthropometric indices and blood pressure (BP) stratified by gender. METHODS Cross-sectional analyses were performed using data from 2,105 adults from the ESTEBAN survey, a representative sample of the French population. Partial Pearson correlation analysis was used to assess the correlation between BP and anthropometric indices. Regressions were adjusted on age, antihypertensive therapies, socioeconomic levels, dietary intakes, and cardiovascular risk factors. A weight variation index, as adjusted weight variation/year, was calculated as (weight maximum − weight minimum) / (age of weight max − age of weight min). This index was adjusted on the BMI reported during the inclusion and time elapsed since weight variation from the moment of inclusion. RESULTS In the Esteban population stratified by gender, this weight index had the highest r-value of correlation with all BP parameters compared with all anthropometric indices (WC, WHR, WHtR) in both genders. In men, weight variation more than +1 kg/year is associated with 5.5 mm Hg increase in systolic BP and with 1.8 mm Hg increase in diastolic BP. In women, more than +1 kg/year is associated with 3.3 mm Hg increase in systolic BP and with 1.0 mm Hg increase in diastolic BP. CONCLUSION A dynamic view of body weight change appears more predictive in BP change than a static view expressed by BMI. Public health initiatives to maintain a youthful body weight during life course are majors to prevent hypertension."
83,10.1038/ajh.2010.225,"Background Administration of caffeine or caffeinated coffee in laboratory and ambulatory settings results in small to moderate acute increases in blood pressure (BP). However, habitual coffee intake has not been linked conclusively to long-term increases in basal BP, and findings are inconsistent by sex. This study examined longitudinal relations of habitual coffee use to resting BP and pulse pressure. Methods In a sample of 2,442 participants from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), coffee consumption was used to predict resting systolic and diastolic BP and pulse pressure using longitudinal mixed-effects regression models adjusted for age, education, antihypertensive, and antihyperlipidemic use, smoking, and body mass index (BMI). Analyses were stratified by sex (865 women and 1,577 men), and age and BMI were examined as possible effect modifiers. Results In men, we identified a significant three-way interaction among coffee intake (nonlinear), baseline age, and length of follow-up for systolic BP (SBP) and pulse pressure. A significant interaction of coffee intake and BMI (nonlinear) was also noted for SBP in men. There were no significant relations of coffee intake to BP or pulse pressure in women. Conclusion Greater coffee intake in men was associated with steeper age-related increases in SBP and pulse pressure, particularly beyond 70 years of age and in overweight to obese men."

This study tested the hypothesis that significant associations are present between height and blood pressure in a representative sample of the US adult population.Participants were 12,988 men and women from a multiethnic sample (age>18 years) evaluated in the 1999 to 2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey who were not taking antihypertensive medications and who had complete height, weight, % body fat, and systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressure (SBP and DBP) measurements; mean arterial blood pressure and pulse pressure (MBP and PP) were calculated. Multiple regression models for men and women were developed with each blood pressure as dependent variable and height, age, race/ethnicity, body mass index, % body fat, socioeconomic status, activity level, and smoking history as potential independent variables. Greater height was associated with significantly lower SBP and PP, and higher DBP (all P<.001) in combined race/ethnic–sex group models beginning in the 4th decade. Predicted blood pressure differences between people who are short and tall increased thereafter with greater age except for MBP. Socioeconomic status, activity level, and smoking history did not consistently contribute to blood pressure prediction models. Height-associated blood pressure effects were present in US adults who appeared in the 4th decade and increased in magnitude with greater age thereafter. These observations, in the largest and most diverse population sample evaluated to date, provide support for postulated mechanisms linking adult stature with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease risk."

The relations among age, relative weight, and blood pressure were examined through assessment of mean blood pressure levels and prevalence of hypertension in 25 subgroups stratified by age (18–24, 25–34, 35–44, 45–54, and 55–64 years) and by relative weight (<100%, 100-109%, 110–119%, 120–134%, and ≥135%). For all five relative weight groups, for both men and women, mean diastolic blood pressure was higher at successive ages. This phenomenon was also seen for systolic blood pressure after ages 35–44 years for men, and after ages 25–34 years for women. On the other hand, the higher the relative weight was, the higher the blood pressure was. Regression analysis demonstrated that the observed relation between age and blood pressure was consistent for all five relative weight groups, including those at desirable weight. These data indicate that for US subjects, age and blood pressure are generally associated in the absence of overweight."
86,10.4236/ojped.2013.32022,"Because of the paucity of serial blood pressure data on the same individuals, little is known about the accuracy of elevated blood pressure (BP) in childhood for predicting hypertension (HBP) later in life. The availability of long-term serial BP data from the Fels Longitudinal Study (FLS) presents the opportunity to link HBP in adulthood directly to BP measured decades earlier in the same individuals as children. We analyzed serial data from 965 men and 1114 women in the FLS. We used an autoregressive-moving average (1, 1) [ARMA (1, 1)] longitudinal model to predict adult HBP from childhood values. For 15-year-old boys with SBP 15 mmHg and 30 mmHg above the average SBP of 90 mmHg, the probabilities of having HBP at age 35 are 0.18 and 0.33, respectively. The corresponding probabilities for 15-year-old girls are only 0.04 and 0.08. This striking sex difference in risk of HBP at age 35 between 15-year-old boys and girls indicates that the risk of developing HBP in women is low regardless of their childhood blood pressure at any age from 2 to 17 years. Men are about 4.25 times more likely to have HBP at age 35 than women over a range of SBP of 90 – 140 mmHg at age 15. The ARMA (1, 1) model allows the identification of boys at risk for HBP as adult men."

88,10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.121.18086,"Racial and ethnic differences in blood pressure (BP), regardless of antihypertensive medication use, contribute to cardiovascular disease disparities. We analyzed systolic BP (SBP) data from US adults in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 1999 to 2002 through 2015 to 2018 (n=51 743) to determine if racial and ethnicity disparities have changed over time. Among US adults not taking antihypertensive medication, the mean age-adjusted SBP (95% CI), mm Hg, in 1999 to 2002 and 2015 to 2018 was 119.6 (118.7–120.5) and 119.4 (118.7–120.1) for non-Hispanic White adults, 124.7 (123.7–125.7) and 124.9 (123.8–125.9) for non-Hispanic Black adults and 120.4 (118.6–122.2) and 120.4 (119.7–121.2) for Hispanic adults.

89,10.1161/01.hyp.32.5.813,"Although race is widely used in hypertension research as a marker of increased risk, its meaning as an etiologic quantity is obscure. Because of its importance as a social category in American life, separating what we “know” about race through socialization from what can be known on the basis of scientific inquiry is difficult. This dilemma represents a specific example of how social influences impact the conduct of science. While the process by which evidence is gathered and evaluated is usually constrained by an existing theoretical model (the “hypothetico-deductive process”), hypotheses arise more informally from the interplay of “inspiration” and “intuition.” Although hypothesis generation is at the core of scientific activity, it is peculiarly vulnerable to the influences of ideology. Contemporary perspectives on science as a practical human activity thus acknowledge that inspiration and intuition are the products of imagination and, as such, are derived from the investigator’s experience—both inside and outside the laboratory. While it is necessary to take account of the assumptions about race that are generated by our participation in a racially stratified society, it is also necessary to define exactly what we can know about race through the conduct of science. In this discussion, we are interested in moving beyond concerns about social influences on hypothesis generation and will attempt to address the logic of studies that use race comparisons to examine causal relationships. Specifically, we ask the question, “Can available statistical adjustment methods lead to valid inferences when race is regarded as an etiologic quantity, rather than a broad indicator of risk factor status?” Despite the popularity of racial hypotheses, we argue that comparative studies based on observations of broad phenotypes—such as high blood pressure, obesity, or glucose intolerance—have little potential to contribute new knowledge. The attempt to interpret race as a causal entity founders on technical and logical flaws, above and beyond the ambiguity of race as a biological construct. To support that assertion, we review the use of race in hypertension research and make specific methodological criticisms. We close with a recommendation for at least one alternative direction for etiologic research on hypertension when investigators wish to exploit the “ethnic paradigm.”"
90,- missing  https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db289.htm,"Hypertension remains an important public health challenge in the United States because it increases the risk for cardiovascular disease. Effective blood pressure management has been shown to decrease the incidence of stroke, heart attack, and heart failure (1–3). This report presents updated estimates (4) for the prevalence and control of hypertension in the United States for 2015–2016. Trends in hypertension prevalence and control from 1999–2000 through 2015–2016 are also presented. Overall, the U.S. prevalence of hypertension among adults was 29.0% during 2015–2016, with no significant change in prevalence since 1999–2000. However, among adults with hypertension, hypertension control increased from 1999–2000 to 2009–2010 and then did not significantly change through 2015–2016. No significant differences were seen between 2013–2014 and 2015–2016. Hypertension prevalence increased with age and was 33.2% among those aged 40–59 and 63.1% among those aged 60 and over. About one-half of all adults aged 40 and over with hypertension had controlled hypertension. However, among those aged 18–39 with hypertension, 15.5% of men had controlled hypertension compared with 62.6% of women. Hypertension prevalence was highest among non-Hispanic black men and women. Hispanic women also had a higher prevalence of hypertension than non-Hispanic Asian women. Controlled hypertension, however, was generally higher among non-Hispanic white adults than among non-Hispanic black and non-Hispanic Asian adults. Controlled hypertension was also higher for non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black women than for their male counterparts. Despite progress in hypertension control that has been noted in the United States over the years, the goal of Healthy People 2020 (61.2% by 2020) has not been met (5). Currently, just less than one-half of adults with hypertension have their hypertension under control (48.3%)."
91,10.1161/01.HYP.29.1.30,"A wide range of definitions is used to distinguish subjects in whom blood pressure (BP) falls at night (dippers) from their counterparts (nondippers). In an attempt to standardize the definition of nondipping, we determined the nocturnal BP fall and night-day BP ratio by 24-hour ambulatory monitoring in 4765 normotensive and 2555 hypertensive subjects from 10 to 99 years old. In all subjects combined, the systolic/diastolic nocturnal fall and corresponding ratio averaged (±SD) −16.7±11.0/−13.6±8.1 mm Hg and 87.2±8.0%/83.1±9.6%, respectively. In normotensive subjects, the 95th percentiles were −0.3/−1.1 mm Hg for the nocturnal fall and 99.7%/98.3% for the night-day ratio. Both the fall and ratio showed a curvilinear correlation with age. The smallest fall and largest ratio were observed in older (≥70 years) subjects. A higher BP on conventional sphygmomanometry was associated with a larger systolic (partial r=.11) and diastolic (r=.12) nocturnal BP fall. The diastolic (r=.08) but not the systolic night-day ratio increased with higher conventional BP. The nocturnal BP fall was larger and the corresponding night-day ratio smaller in oscillometric (n=5884) than in auscultatory (n=1436) recordings, in males (n=3730) than in females (n=3590), and in Europe (n=4556) than in the other continents (n=2764). The distributions of the nocturnal BP fall and night-day ratio showed considerable overlap among normotensive and hypertensive subjects, but the overlap tended to be larger for the ratio than for the fall. Of all subjects, 3.2% had systolic and diastolic ratios of 100% or more. With adjustments applied for confounders, the probability of being a nondipper increased 2.8 times (95% confidence interval, 2.0-4.0) from 30 to 60 years and 5.7 times (4.4-7.4) from 60 to 80 years. The odds ratios were 1.0 (0.8-1.4) for males versus females, 1.6 (1.2-2.1) for subjects with definite hypertension versus normotensive subjects, 2.4 (1.2-4.7) for Asians (n=2213, 96% Japanese) versus inhabitants of the other continents, and 2.4 (1.5-3.8) for subjects examined with auscultatory versus oscillometric devices. In conclusion, the mathematical definition of nondipping, ie, having a night-day ratio of 100% or more for systolic and diastolic BPs, closely approximated the 95th percentiles of the night-day ratio in normotensive subjects. The ratio depends less on BP level than the nocturnal BP fall and is therefore to be preferred in the definition of dipping status. Notwithstanding the present findings, the reproducibility of nondipping and its prognostic significance need further clarification."
92,10.1161/01.HYP.31.5.1190,"Black hypertensive persons have been observed to have a greater degree of left ventricular hypertrophy than white hypertensives. However, previous studies have matched groups for blood pressure (BP) measured in the clinic, and it has been demonstrated that black hypertensives have an attenuated nocturnal BP dip. Clinic BPs may thus underestimate mean 24-hour BP in this group. To investigate whether the differences in left ventricular hypertrophy can be accounted for by the greater mean 24-hour BP in black hypertensives, 92 previously untreated hypertensives were studied with 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring and echocardiography. The 46 black hypertensives (24 men and 22 women) were matched with the 46 white hypertensives for age, gender, and mean 24-hour BP. Despite similar mean 24-hour BPs (blacks, 142/93 mm Hg; whites, 145/92 mm Hg; P=.53/.66), the black group had a smaller mean nocturnal dip than the white group (blacks, 8/8 mm Hg; whites, 16/13 mm Hg; P<.01). In addition, mean left ventricular mass index (LVMI) was greater (blacks, 130 g/m2; whites, 107 g/m2; P<.001). Mean 24-hour systolic BP was significantly related to LVMI in both groups (blacks, r=.45, P<.01; whites, r=.56, P<.01). However, systolic BP dip correlated inversely with LVMI only in the black group (blacks, r=−.30, P<.04; whites, r=.05, P=.76). In a multiple regression model, LVMI was independently related to both mean daytime BP and mean nocturnal BP dip in black subjects but only to mean daytime BP in white subjects. In conclusion, the increased left ventricular hypertrophy observed in black hypertensives compared with white hypertensives is not accounted for by differences in mean 24-hour BP. However, LVMI in black hypertensives appears to be more dependent on nocturnal BP than that in white hypertensives; this, coupled with the attenuated BP dip in black hypertensives, suggests that the BP profile rather than 24-hour BP may be important in determining the differences in left ventricular hypertrophy."
93,10.1161/01.HYP.36.2.165,"Obesity is associated with elevated blood pressure (BP) both in adults and children. Childhood obesity has become a severe health problem, especially during the last few decades. So far there has not been any large-scale study specifically focusing on the association between obesity and BP in early life. The aim of this study is to examine systematically the association between obesity and BP in preschool Chinese children in mainland China. In 1996, measurements of weight, height, and BP values were collected in a nationwide, case-control study of 748 boys and 574 girls who ranged in age from 0.1 to 6.9 years in 8 cities in mainland China. One obese child and 1 nonobese child were matched for gender and age. The BP differences of the mean-matched pair were ≈5 mm Hg for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and ≈4 mm Hg for diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (P<0.05); a higher value was noted in obese children. The BP value of 19.4% children in the obese group and 7.0% children in the nonobese group was higher than the 95th percentile value (P<0.0001), which is defined as high BP by the Task Force on Blood Pressure Control in Children. Both SBP and DBP were significantly (P<0.05) positively related to body mass index (BMI) values (P<0.05) for children in obese and nonobese groups after adjustment for age, gender, and height. To be specific, an increase of 1 BMI unit was associated with, on average, an increase of 0.56 mm Hg and 0.54 mm Hg in SBP and DBP, respectively, for obese children. In nonobese children, the increase in SBP and DBP was 1.22 mm Hg and 1.20 mm Hg, respectively. An increase in the BMI is conclusively associated with elevated SBP and DBP in nonobese children. Furthermore, an increase in the adjusted BMI was associated with an increase in SBP and DBP in obese and nonobese children."
94,10.4103/cjhr.cjhr_11_18,"Background: Children of school age group in developing countries are facing the problem of overweight and obesity because of lifestyle change, playing video games, watching television as well as consuming energy rich diet. Childhood obesity continues as obesity in adulthood. The chance of high blood pressure (BP) in overweight and obese children is more than healthy weight children. Objectives: (i) Effect of body mass index (BMI) on BP. (ii) Association of overweight and obesity with hypertension (HTN). Materials and Methods: This study included 580 students of age group 6–12 years of both boys and girls. All students were from English medium school. Measurement of height and weight was done by standard procedure. BMI was calculated by weight and height. BP measurement was done by auscultatory method. Statistical analysis was done by SPSS 16. Results: Overweight and obesity were more in boys than girls. There was significantly more BP in overweight and obese participants than healthy weight individuals. There was positive correlation between BMI and BP both systolic and diastolic BP. Prevalence of HTN in boys is more than the girls. Odds ratio suggested that overweight and obesity was associated with HTN. Conclusion: This study concludes that overweight and obese school students were prone to develop elevated BP and HTN and hence were prone to cardiovascular risk."
95,10.1161/01.HYP.0000094221.86888.AE,"Increased body weight is a strong risk factor for hypertension. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials was performed to estimate the effect of weight reduction on blood pressure overall and in population subgroups. Twenty-five randomized, controlled trials (comprising 34 strata) published between 1966 and 2002 with a total of 4874 participants were included. A random-effects model was used to account for heterogeneity among trials. A net weight reduction of −5.1 kg (95% confidence interval [CI], −6.03 to −4.25) by means of energy restriction, increased physical activity, or both reduced systolic blood pressure by −4.44 mm Hg (95% CI, −5.93 to −2.95) and diastolic blood pressure by −3.57 mm Hg (95% CI, −4.88 to −2.25). Blood pressure reductions were −1.05 mm Hg (95% CI, −1.43 to −0.66) systolic and −0.92 mm Hg (95% CI, −1.28 to −0.55) diastolic when expressed per kilogram of weight loss. As expected, significantly larger blood pressure reductions were observed in populations with an average weight loss >5 kg than in populations with less weight loss, both for systolic (−6.63 mm Hg [95% CI, −8.43 to −4.82] vs −2.70 mm Hg [95% CI, −4.59 to −0.81]) and diastolic (−5.12 mm Hg [95% CI, −6.48 to −3.75] vs −2.01 mm Hg [95% CI, −3.47 to −0.54]) blood pressure. The effect on diastolic blood pressure was significantly larger in populations taking antihypertensive drugs than in untreated populations (−5.31 mm Hg [95% CI, −6.64 to −3.99] vs −2.91 mm Hg [95% CI, −3.66 to −2.16]). This meta-analysis clearly shows that weight loss is important for the prevention and treatment of hypertension."
97,10.1055/s-0032-1323819,"This investigation was designed to evaluate responses of blood pressure (BP) following an acute resistance exercise (RE) session. Middle-aged women (N=13) who were classified as overweight (N=8) or obese (N=5) according to body mass index (BMI) participated in the investigation. Participants were randomly submitted to a control session (30-min seated rest) and a exercise session (3 sets, 10 repetitions at 60% 1RM of exercises for the upper and lower body) with systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP) and mean blood pressure (MBP) obtained at rest and 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60-min following exercise, and through 24 h. Acute RE decreased SBP at 10, 30, and 40-min compared with pre-exercise and control (P<0.05). DBP decreased at 10 and 40-min post-exercise compared with the control trial (P<0.05). Both SBP and DBP decreased in the nighttime period ( − 4.2 mmHg and  − 4.1 mmHg, respectively) and in the overall 24 h period ( − 3.6 mmHg and  − 4.5 mmHg, respectively) following the acute RE session when compared with the control trial. These findings indicate important benefits of acute RE on BP circadian rhythm, particularly at night as well as in the morning, which are critical periods associated with increased risk for cardiovascular events."
98,10.1016/j.nut.2013.02.016,"Objective Moderate consumption of beer is associated with lower cardiovascular (CV) risk. The goal of this study was to determine the effect of beer consumption on CV risk. To explore the underlying mechanisms, we studied the acute effects of the constituents of beer (alcohol and antioxidants), on established predictors of CV risk: endothelial function, aortic stiffness, pressure wave reflections and aortic pressure. Methods In a randomized, single-blind, crossover study, 17 healthy, non-smoking, men (ages 28.5 ± 5.2 y with body mass index 24.4 ± 2.5 kg/m2) consumed on three separate occasions, at least 1 wk apart: 1. 400 mL of beer and 400 mL water, 2. 800 mL of dealcoholized beer (same amount of polyphenols as in the 400 mL of beer), and 3. 67 mL of vodka and 733 mL water (same amount of alcohol as in the 400 mL of beer). Each time aortic stiffness (pulse wave velocity), pressure wave reflections (AΙx), aortic and brachial pressure (Sphygmocor device), and endothelial function (brachial flow mediated dilatation) were assessed at fast and 1 and 2 h postprandial.Results Artic stiffness was significantly and similarly reduced by all three interventions. However, endothelial function was significantly improved only after beer consumption (average 1.33%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.15–2.53). Although wave reflections were significantly reduced by all three interventions (average of beer: 9.1%, dealcoholized beer: 2.8%, vodka 8.5%, all CI within limits of significance), the reduction was higher after beer consumption compared with dealcoholized beer (P = 0.018). Pulse pressure amplification (i.e., brachial/aortic) was increased by all three test drinks. Beer acutely improves parameters of arterial function and structure, in healthy non-smokers. This benefit seems to be mediated by the additive or synergistic effects of alcohol and antioxidants and merits further investigation."
99,10.1038/jhh.2015.19,"The aim of this study was to assess the effect of alcohol on blood pressure and arterial compliance over 24 h in a group of volunteers, comparing the same group of subjects on two consecutive but separate days, one with alcohol intake (alcohol day) and one free of alcohol (control day). We studied 18 healthy subjects (mean age 34.2 years, range 25–53). The subjects received the two days in random order. On the alcohol day, the subjects were asked to drink two glasses of red wine (12% ethanol) between 1830 hours and 0430 hours. Measurements of heart rate, blood pressure and QKD interval (Q wave to Korotkoff (K) sound, diastolic phase (D) using Diasys Integra (Novacor, France)) were recorded (usually 1500 hours to 1500 hours). Three ‘ingestion’periods were defined, from 1500 hours to 1830 hours (‘before’), 1900 hours to 0430 hours (‘during’) and from 0430 hours to the following afternoon (‘after’) on both the alcohol day and on the control day. Red wine increased heart rate during alcohol ingestion and reduced arterial compliance after ingestion. The significant effect of interaction between day and ingestion period on heart rate, diastolic blood pressure and QKD were found, suggesting that the differences in response among the ingestion periods depended on whether alcohol has been consumed that day. For the first time our study indicates the effect of alcohol on 24 h arterial stiffness in a healthy group of volunteers."
100,10.3109/08037050903516318,"Objective. Wide pulse pressure (PP) affects the accuracy of oscillometric blood pressure measurements (OBPM): however, the degree of this impact on different patient groups with wide PPs is unclear. This study will investigate the accuracy of OBPM in achieving target BP and PP in isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) group compared with mixed hypertension (MHT) group. Method. A total of 115 patients (70 with ISH and 45 with MHT) were enrolled in the study. Upper arm and wrist OBPM, obtained by OmronM3 and OmronR6 devices respectively, were compared with the simultaneously measured values from the ascending aorta. The ISH was defined as a systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥140 mmHg and a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) <90 mmHg. MHT was defined as a SBP≥140 mmHg and a DBP≥90 mmHg. Results. The mean central arterial blood pressure (BP) and central PP were higher in the ISH group than those in the MHT group. The upper arm OBPM underestimated the central SBP in two groups (−5 mmHg, −3 mmHg, p=0.5, respectively), but overestimated DBP in the ISH group compared with MHT patients (6.8 mmHg, 1 mmHg, p=0.04, respectively). Wrist OBPM similarly underestimated to the central SBP in each group (−16 mmHg, −19 mmHg, p=0.15), whereas the sum of overestimation of DBP was significantly higher in the ISH than in the MHT group (+6 mmHg, − 1 mmHg, p=0.001, respectively). Also, each of the devices underestimated the central PP in the ISH group (about 10 mmHg) as being higher than that of the MHT group. Conclusion. Oscillometric devices may be used for self-BP measurement in patients with ISH without clinically important disadvantages compared with the patients with MHT. For PP measurement in patients with ISH, there were substantial differences between intra-arterial and indirect arm BP measurements."
101,10.1080/10641963.2016.1226891,"Water aerobics exercise is widely recommended for elderly people. However, little is known about the acute effects on hemodynamic variables. Thus, we assessed the effects of a water aerobic session on blood pressure in hypertensive elderly women. Fifty hypertensive elderly women aged 67.8 ± 4.1 years, 1.5 ± 0.6 m high and BMI 28.6 ± 3.9 kg/m2, participated in a crossover clinical trial. The experiment consisted of a 45-minute water aerobics session (70%–75% HRmax adjusted for the aquatic environment) (ES) and a control session (no exercise for 45 minutes) (CS). Heart rate was monitored using a heart rate monitor and systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) measurements were taken using a semi-automatic monitor before and immediately after the sessions, and at 10, 20 and 30 minutes thereafter. It was using a generalized estimating equation (GEE) with Bonferroni’s post-hoc test (p < 0.05). At the end of the experimental session, ES showed a rise in SBP of 17.4 mmHg (14.3%, p < 0.001) and DBP of 5.4 mmHg (7.8%, p < 0.001) compared to CS. At 10 minutes after exercise, BP declined in ES by a greater magnitude than in CS (SBP 7.5 mmHg, 6.2%, p = 0.005 and DBP 3.8 mmHg, 5.5%, p = 0.013). At 20 minutes after exercise and thereafter, SBP and DBP were similar in both ES and CS. In conclusion, BP returned to control levels within 10–20 minutes remaining unchanged until 30 minutes after exercise, and post-exercise hypotension was not observed. Besides, BP changed after exercise was a safe rise of small magnitude for hypertensive people."
102,10.1038/sj.jhh.1001573,"The position of both the body and the arm during indirect blood pressure (BP) measurement is often neglected. The aim of the present study was to test the influence of the position of the patient on BP readings:(1) sitting with the arms supported precisely at the right atrium level and (2) supine:(a) with the arms precisely at the right atrium level and (b) with the arms on the examination bed. In a first group of 57 hypertensive patients, two sessions of BP and heart rate (HR) measurements were performed in two positions: sitting and supine with the arms supported precisely at right atrium level in both positions. BP was measured simultaneously at both arms, with a Hawksley Random Zero sphygmomanometer at the right arm, and with an automated oscillometric device (Bosomat) at the left arm. BP and HR readings obtained in the two positions were then compared. In a second group of 25 normo-and hypertensive persons, two sessions of BP and HR readings were performed in supine with the arms in two different arm positions:(a) the arm placed precisely at right atrium level and (b) the other arm on the examination bed. The measurements were performed at both arms with two automated devices (Bosomat). The readings taken in the two positions were compared. Both systolic BP (SBP; by 9.5±9.0 (standard deviation, sd); right arm) and diastolic BP (DBP; by 4.8±6.0 mmHg; right arm) were significantly higher in the supine than in the sitting position. When the two different arm positions (body continously supine) were compared in the second part of the study, significantly higher SBP (by 4.6±6.1 mmHg) and DBP (by 3.9±2.8 mmHg) were obtained when the arm of the patient was placed on the bed (below the right atrium level), than when the arm was placed at the level of the right atrium. BP readings in sitting and supine positions are not the same. When according to guidelines the arm of the patient is meticulously placed at the right atrium level in both positions, the difference is even greater than when the arm rests on the desk or on the arm support of the chair. Moreover, in the supine position small but significant differences in BP are measured between arm on a 5 cm-high pillow and arm on the bed. In every study reporting BP values, the position of both the body and especially the arm should be precisely mentioned."
103,10.1016/j.envpol.2016.03.074,"More than 35 million people in coastal Bangladesh are vulnerable to increasing freshwater salinization. This will continue to affect more people and to a greater extent as climate change projections are realised in this area in the future. However the evidence for health effects of consuming high salinity water is limited. This research examined the association between drinking water salinity and blood pressure in young adults in coastal Bangladesh. We conducted a cross-sectional study during May-June 2014 in a rural coastal sub-district of Bangladesh. Data on blood pressure (BP) and salinity of potable water sources was collected from 253 participants aged 19–25 years. A linear regression method was used to examine the association between water salinity exposure categories and systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) level. Sixty five percent of the study population were exposed to highly saline drinking water above the Bangladesh standard (600 mg/L and above). Multivariable linear regression analyses identified that compared to the low water salinity exposure category (<600 mg/L), those in the high water salinity category (>600 mg/L), had statistically significantly higher SBP (B 3.46, 95% CI 0.75, 6.17; p = 0.01) and DBP (B 2.77, 95% CI 0.31, 5.24; p = 0.03). Our research shows that elevated salinity in drinking water is associated with higher BP in young coastal populations. Blood pressure is an important risk factor of hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. Given the extent of salinization of freshwater in many low-lying countries including in Bangladesh, and the likely exacerbation related to climate change-induced sea level rise, implementation of preventative strategies through dietary interventions along with promotion of low saline drinking water must be a priority in these settings."
104,10.1016/j.envint.2019.01.045,"Background Several epidemiological studies have shown that blood pressure changes with temperature based on the daily temperature and linear relationship assumption. However, little is known about the true curve shape of the relationship between temperature and blood pressure. Objectives The objective of this study was to investigate the non-linear relationship between hourly temperature and blood pressure. Methods This is a prospective panel study comprising 100 participants in Suzhou, China. The blood pressure of each participant was measured >50 times between October 2013 and January 2016. Hourly temperature data were derived from the nearest monitoring station owned by the China Meteorological Administration. A Distributed Lag Nonlinear Model (DLNM) was used to investigate the relationship between hourly temperature and blood pressure. Results We found that the relationship between hourly temperature and blood pressure was parabolic. Short-term exposure to hourly temperatures had significant cold and heat effects on systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), pulse pressure (PP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP). The hourly temperature had a significant lag effect on blood pressure, with a lag time of 0–5h. Alcohol users were more sensitive to the cold effects of hourly temperature, and the diabetic population was more sensitive to the heat effects of hourly temperature on PP. Conclusion Temperature imparts short-term effects on blood pressure. Therefore, timely protective measures during cold waves or cold weather are beneficial to maintain stable blood pressure levels to reduce the risk of blood pressure related diseases."
105,10.3109/08958378.2016.1171934,"Background: Waterpipe smoking is becoming a popular way of tobacco use in the world. Its acute effects on the cardiovascular system are not well investigated. Materials and methods: This is a trial designed to evaluate the acute effects of waterpipe smoking on blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) in healthy adults. Individuals who ordered waterpipe in 6 Lebanese restaurants were enrolled (cases) and were compared to controls who consisted of subjects who were sitting at the same table of smokers but who did not smoke (passive smokers) and of subjects who were sitting in nonsmoking sections (nonsmokers). BP and HR were measured immediately before and 15min after smoking or at baseline and 15min later in controls. Results: A total of 194 subjects were enrolled: 101 waterpipe smokers, 51 passive smokers, and 42 nonsmokers. Systolic and diastolic BP and HR significantly increased after 15min of smoking in cases (mean 3.1mm Hg (95% CI 0.8–5.5; p=0.009) for systolic BP, 2.1 mm Hg (95% CI 0–4.2; p=0.053) for diastolic BP, and 6.3 beats/minute (95% CI 4.3–8.3; p<0.001) for HR, but did not change in controls. Conclusions: Waterpipe smoking for duration as short as 15min has acute hemodynamic effects and significantly increases systolic BP and HR."

The correlations between ABP and supBP/OBP were moderate and strong (correlation coefficients in range 0.55–0.76). The ROC analysis revealed that mean supBP≥ 130/80 mm Hg was more precise than OBP≥ 140/90 mm Hg in diagnosing hypertension (AUC: 0.820 vs. 0.550; sensitivity 80.7% vs. 57.4%; specificity 83.2% vs. 52.7%; p< 0.0001) and the additive value derived mostly from its higher predictive power of identifying patients with increased night-time BP. Conclusions: In young and middle-aged hypertensive patients the blood pressure during a 10-minute supine rest was lower than in the sitting position. The supine blood pressure≥ 130/80 mm Hg was found to be a specific and sensitive threshold for hypertension."
107,10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.119.12958,"Participant-level meta-analyses assessed the age-specific relevance of office blood pressure to cardiovascular complications, but this information is lacking for out-of-office blood pressure. At baseline, daytime ambulatory (n=12 624) or home (n=5297) blood pressure were measured in 17 921 participants (51.3% women; mean age, 54.2 years) from 17 population cohorts. Subsequently, mortality and cardiovascular events were recorded. Using multivariable Cox regression, floating absolute risk was computed across 4 age bands (≤60, 61–70, 71–80, and >80 years). Over 236 491 person-years, 3855 people died and 2942 cardiovascular events occurred. From levels as low as 110/65 mm Hg, risk log-linearly increased with higher out-of-office systolic/diastolic blood pressure. From the youngest to the oldest age group, rates expressed per 1000 person-years increased (P<0.001) from 4.4 (95% CI, 4.0–4.7) to 86.3 (76.1–96.5) for all-cause mortality and from 4.1 (3.9–4.6) to 59.8 (51.0–68.7) for cardiovascular events, whereas hazard ratios per 20-mm Hg increment in systolic out-of-office blood pressure decreased (P≤0.0033) from 1.42 (1.19–1.69) to 1.09 (1.05–1.12) and from 1.70 (1.51–1.92) to 1.12 (1.07–1.17), respectively. These age-related trends were similar for out-of-office diastolic pressure and were generally consistent in both sexes and across ethnicities. In conclusion, adverse outcomes were directly associated with out-of-office blood pressure in adults. At young age, the absolute risk associated with out-of-office blood pressure was low, but relative risk high, whereas with advancing age relative risk decreased and absolute risk increased. These observations highlight the need of a lifecourse approach for the management of hypertension."
108,10.1001/jama.2019.10575,"Importance The association between late-life blood pressure (BP) and cognition may depend on the presence and chronicity of past hypertension. Late-life declines in blood pressure following prolonged hypertension may be associated with poor cognitive outcomes. Objective To examine the association of midlife to late-life BP patterns with subsequent dementia, mild cognitive impairment, and cognitive decline. Design, Setting, and Participants The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities prospective population-based cohort study enrolled 4761 participants during midlife (visit 1, 1987-1989) and followed-up over 6 visits through 2016-2017 (visit 6). BP was examined over 24 years at 5 in-person visits between visits 1 and 5 (2011-2013). During visits 5 and 6, participants underwent detailed neurocognitive evaluation. The setting was 4 US communities: Washington County, Maryland; Forsyth County, North Carolina; Jackson, Mississippi; and Minneapolis, Minnesota. Follow-up ended on December 31, 2017. Exposures Five groups based on longitudinal patterns of normotension, hypertension (>140/90 mm Hg), and hypotension (<90/60 mm Hg) at visits 1 to 5. Main Outcomes and Measures Primary outcome was dementia onset after visit 5, based on Ascertain Dementia-8 informant questionnaires, Six-Item Screener telephone assessments, hospital discharge and death certificate codes, and the visit 6 neurocognitive evaluation. Secondary outcome was mild cognitive impairment at visit 6, based on the neurocognitive evaluation. Results Among 4761 participants (2821 [59%] women; 979 [21%] black race; visit 5 mean [SD] age, 75 [5] years; visit 1 mean age range, 44-66 years; visit 5 mean age range, 66-90 years), there were 516 (11%) incident dementia cases between visits 5 and 6. The dementia incidence rate for participants with normotension in midlife (n=833) and late life was 1.31 (95% CI, 1.00-1.72 per 100 person-years); for midlife normotension and late-life hypertension (n=1559), 1.99 (95% CI, 1.69-2.32 per 100 person-years); for midlife and late-life hypertension (n=1030), 2.83 (95% CI, 2.40-3.35 per 100 person-years); for midlife normotension and late-life hypotension (n=927), 2.07 (95% CI, 1.68-2.54 per 100 person-years); and for midlife hypertension and late-life hypotension (n=389), 4.26 (95% CI, 3.40-5.32 per 100 person-years). Participants in the midlife and late-life hypertension group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.49 [95% CI, 1.06-2.08]) and in the midlife hypertension and late-life hypotension group (HR, 1.62 [95% CI, 1.11-2.37]) had significantly increased risk of subsequent dementia compared with those who remained normotensive. Irrespective of late-life BP, sustained hypertension in midlife was associated with dementia risk (HR, 1.41 [95% CI, 1.17-1.71]). Compared with those who were normotensive in midlife and late life, only participants with midlife hypertension and late-life hypotension had higher risk of mild cognitive impairment (37 affected individuals (odds ratio, 1.65 [95% CI, 1.01-2.69]). There was no significant association of BP patterns with late-life cognitive change. Conclusions and Relevance In this community-based cohort with long-term follow-up, sustained hypertension in midlife to late life and a pattern of midlife hypertension and late-life hypotension, compared with midlife and late-life normal BP, were associated with increased risk for subsequent dementia. Over 24 years plus follow-up, this community-based cohort study monitored individuals categorized by midlife and late-life blood pressure levels to evaluate association between blood pressure levels and incident dementia."
109,10.1016/j.amjcard.2007.03.055,"Multiple studies have documented an increased incidence of cardiovascular events in the winter, but the pathophysiological mechanisms remain incompletely understood. We hypothesized that brachial flow and flow-mediated dilation (FMD) would vary by season and temperature. We related season and temperature to ultrasonic brachial artery endothelium-dependent FMD% (n=2587), baseline flow velocity and maximal reactive hyperemia (n=1973) in the Framingham Offspring cohort (mean age 61±10 years; 53% women). We obtained outdoor temperature from National Climate Data Center records for Bedford, Massachusetts (about 14 miles from testing site) and we measured the examination room temperature. In multivariable models, FMD% was highest in summer and lowest in winter (3.01±0.09 vs. 2.56±0.10%, respectively; P=0.02 for differences across all 4 seasons). FMD% was highest in the warmest and lowest in the coldest outdoor temperature quartiles. In stepwise models adjusting for risk factors, and selecting among season, outdoor temperature, and room temperature, FMD% was associated with season (P=0.02); temperature did not enter the model. In contrast, hyperemic flow velocity was significantly lower for cooler, and higher for warmer room temperatures (P=0.02 overall); season did not enter the model. Season, outdoor and room temperature were each retained in a stepwise model of baseline flow velocity (P<0.0001, P=0.02, P<0.0001, respectively). In conclusion, we observed a significant association between season and FMD. Microvascular vasodilator function, as reflected by hyperemic flow, was more strongly related to temperature than season. In conclusion, we speculate that endothelial dysfunction may be 1 of the mechanisms influencing seasonal variation in cardiovascular events."

Methods: Anthropometric indices and blood pressure were measured in 3923 children aged 6-11 years in southern Italy. Results: The prevalence of overweight and obesity (by IOTF references) and pediatric hypertension was, respectively: 27, 21 and 10% for boys; 25, 21 and 14% for girls. Body mass index and waist z-scores were the strongest determinants of BP by regression analysis. Overweight and obesity were associated with a greater tendency for central fat deposition and higher BP (waist, cm; boys: 59.2+/-6.0, 69.5+/-7.9, 79.0+/-9.7; girls: 58.8+/-6.5, 68.2+/-7.4, 75.3+/-8.9; SBP/DBP, mmHg; boys: 94/60+/-12/9, 99/62+/-13/8, 103/64+/-15/10; girls: 93/59+/-12/9, 99/62+/-14/9, 101/63+/-14/9; normal weight, overweight and obese, respectively; P<0.0001; M+/-SD), and a higher risk of hypertension (overweight: RR=2.33; 95% CI 1.76-3.08; obesity: RR=3.69; 95% CI 2.78-4.90), independent of age, physical activity, birth weight, parental adiposity and education. Among normal weight children, 99% had waist <85th percentile and 93% were normotensive. Conclusions: Overweight and obese children, identified according to the IOTF growth charts, are characterized by a central fat distribution pattern and higher BP."

Design A post-hoc analysis of a multicentre clinical trial. Setting Outpatients across Japan with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. Participants Among 3518 randomised participants, 2423 who self-measured HBP during the pretreatment drug-free period (10–28 days after starting fixed-dose antihypertensive monotherapy) with a mean 7.0 years follow-up were eligible. Main outcome measures We analysed individual HBP readings during pretreatment and monotherapy. Results The day-to-day HBP during both the pretreatment period and monotherapy period remains almost the same throughout each period; the results were consistent, regardless of the pretreatment HBP. Following monotherapy, the reduction in the HBP increased by 2.2 mm Hg (95% CI: 1.8 to 2.5 mm Hg) per 10 mm Hg pretreatment HBP increase, up to 11.0 mm Hg (95% CI: 9.9 to 12.0 mm Hg) among patients with an HBP ≥165 mm Hg during pretreatment. Among the 1005 patients receiving low-dose monotherapy (defined daily dose: 0.5 units), the reduction peaked at 8.9–9.1 mm Hg in those with pretreatment HBP 155–164 mm Hg and ≥165 mm Hg (p=0.88). Conclusions According to Wilder’s law, the HBP reduction due to fixed-dose monotherapy was proportional to the pretreatment HBP without any regression to the mean phenomenon. With low-dose antihypertensive drugs, however, the HBP reduction peaked in patients with a high pretreatment HBP, indicating the need for such patients to receive a sufficient amount of antihypertensive drug medication at the initial treatment."
112,10.3967/bes2021.014,"Objective: The relationship between outdoor temperature and blood pressure (BP) has been inconclusive. We analyzed data from a prospective cohort study in northwestern China to investigate the effect of outdoor temperature on BP and effect modification by season. Methods: A total of 32,710 individuals who participated in both the baseline survey and the first follow-up in 2011-2015 were included in the study. A linear mixed-effect model and generalized additive mixed model (GAMM) were applied to estimate the association between outdoor temperature and BP after adjusting for confounding variables. Results: The mean differences in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between summer and winter were 3.5 mmHg and 2.75 mmHg, respectively. After adjusting for individual characteristics, meteorological factors and air pollutants, a significant increase in SBP and DBP was observed for lag 06 day and lag 04 day, a 0.28 mmHg (95% CI: 0.27-0.30) per 1 °C decrease in average temperature for SBP and a 0.16 mmHg (95% CI: 0.15-0.17) per 1 °C decrease in average temperature for DBP, respectively. The effects of the average temperature on both SBP and DBP were stronger in summer than in other seasons. The effects of the average temperature on BP were also greater if individuals were older, male, overweight or obese, a smoker or drinker, or had cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), hypertension, and diabetes. Conclusions: This study demonstrated a significant negative association between outdoor temperature and BP in a high-altitude environment of northwest China. Moreover, BP showed a significant seasonal variation. The association between BP and temperature differed by season and individuals' demographic characteristics (age, gender, BMI), unhealthy behaviors (smoking and alcohol consumption), and chronic disease status (CVDs, hypertension, and diabetes)."
113,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.135762,"Background: Limited evidence is available regarding the potential heterogeneity of ambient temperature on blood pressure (BP) in various climate zones. Objectives: To explore the effect of daily ambient temperature on BP in various climate zones across 31 provinces in China. Methods: A representative population sample (n = 451,770) were obtained from the China Hypertension Survey study (CHS) from October 2012 to December 2015. Survey seasons were divided into warm and cold seasons. Survey sites were divided into three climate zones as subtropical, temperate monsoon and temperate continental zones. Results: After adjustment for confounders, an overall 10 °C decrease in ambient temperature was statistically associated 0.74 mmHg (95% CI: 0.69, 0.79) and 0.60 mmHg (95% CI: -0.63, -0.57) rise for SBP and DBP, respectively. In the warm season, U-shaped exposure-response curves were observed between ambient temperature and BP in temperate monsoon and continental zones, and liner curves in other zones. A greater SBP change due to a lower temperature was observed in subtropical zones, so did DBP in temperate continental zones, especially for cold season. Female, rural and elderly populations were more susceptible to cold weather than their counterparts. Discussion: There is a geographical disparity between temperature and BP across different climate zones, which should been taken into consideration when maintaining stable blood pressure levels."
114,10.1097/HJH.0b013e32835465b5,"Objectives Mean blood pressure varies moderately with outdoor air temperature in many Western populations. Substantial uncertainty exists, however, about the strength of the relationship in other populations, and the relevance to it of age, adiposity, medical treatment, climate and housing conditions.
Methods To investigate the relationship of blood pressure with season and outdoor temperature, we analysed cross-sectional data from the China Kadoorie Biobank study of 506 673 adults aged 30-79 recruited from ten diverse urban and rural regions in China. Analyses related mean blood pressure – overall and in various subgroups – to mean local outdoor temperature.
Results The mean difference in systolic blood pressure (SBP) between summer (June-August) and winter (December-February) was 10 mmHg overall, and was more extreme, on average, in rural than in urban areas (12 vs. 8 mmHg; p for interaction<0.0001). Above 5°C, SBP was strongly inversely associated with outdoor temperature in all ten areas studied, with 5.7 (SE 0.04) mmHg higher SBP per 10°C lower outdoor temperature. The association was stronger in older people and in those with lower body mass index. At lower temperatures there was no evidence of an association among participants who reported having home central heating.
Conclusions Blood pressure was strongly inversely associated with outdoor temperature in Chinese adults across a range of climatic conditions, although access to home central heating appeared to remove much of the association during the winter months. Seasonal variation in blood pressure should be considered in the clinical management of hypertension."
115,10.1097/00004872-200211000-00017,"Objective: To examine the relationship between the normal nocturnal decline in blood pressure and the risk of cardiovascular mortality in individuals with and without high 24-h blood pressure values. Methods: We obtained 24-h ambulatory blood pressure readings from 1542 residents of Ohasama, Japan, who were aged 40 years or more and were representative of the Japanese general population. We then followed up their survival for a mean of 9.2 years. The relationship was analysed using a Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for possible confounding factors. Results: There was a linear relationship between the nocturnal decline in blood pressure and cardiovascular mortality. On average, each 5% decrease in the decline in nocturnal systolic/diastolic blood pressure was associated with an approximately 20% greater risk of cardiovascular mortality. There were no significant interactions for the risk between 24-h systolic/diastolic blood pressure values and continuous values for the nocturnal decline in blood pressure ( for interaction 0.6). Even when 24-h blood pressure values were within the normal range ( 135/80 mmHg, average 118/69 mmHg), diminished nocturnal decreases in systolic/diastolic blood pressure were associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality. Conclusions: This is the first study to demonstrate that a diminished nocturnal decline in blood pressure is a risk factor for cardiovascular mortality, independent of the overall blood pressure load during a 24-h period, in the general population."
116,10.1016/j.ejcnurse.2006.05.001,"Background: Researchers have discovered that blood pressure (BP) varies in a diurnal manner throughout a 24-hour period, being higher during the day and lower at night. Most people have a dipping BP pattern characterized by a nighttime BP that is 10-20% lower than their daytime BP. Individuals who experience a less than 10% reduction in nighttime BP are described as having a nondipping BP pattern. Although controversial, there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that a nondipping BP pattern is associated with a greater risk of target organ damage among individuals with essential hypertension.
Aim: To review the literature on the most common factors associated with nondipping BP patterns among individuals with essential hypertension.
Methods: CINAHL (1982-March 2006), PubMed (1950-March 2006) and Cochrane Library (1966-March 2006) databases were searched using the keywords: dipper, dipping, nondipper, nondipping, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, ABPM, hypertension, essential hypertension, high blood pressure, blood pressure, nocturnal blood pressure, nighttime blood pressure, diurnal blood pressure, and blood pressure patterns. Published studies, abstracts, dissertations as well as the reference lists of retrieved articles were reviewed. Studies were included if they involved subjects with only treated or untreated essential hypertension or those with samples of both nomotensive and treated or untreated essential hypertensive individuals. Additionally, studies needed to evaluate 24-hour, daytime and nighttime BP patterns.
Results: There is some evidence to suggest advanced age, African-American ethnicity, female sex, postmenopausal status, sodium sensitivity, sleep apnea, sleep quality, anger, hostility, depression, stress, social support, and socioeconomic status have an association with nondipping BP patterns.
Conclusion: Knowledge of the potential factors associated with an altered nighttime BP pattern is of importance because it can help identify persons at risk for nondipping BP patterns and potential target organ damage. Furthermore, knowledge of these factors associated with a nondipping BP profile will lay the foundation for interventions to prevent/treat alterations in nighttime BP patterns."
117,10.1097/00041552-200109000-00010,"The non-dipping pattern of blood pressure (defined as a nocturnal fall of less than 10%) occurs in about 25% of hypertensives, with increased prevalence in certain sub-groups such as diabetics, African-Americans, and patients with renal disease. It almost certainly has multiple causes, including factors such as the levels of activity and arousal during both the day and the night, the depth and quality of sleep, and the activity of the sympathetic nervous system, among others. In patients with uncomplicated hypertension, the reproducibility is relatively low. There is evidence suggesting that the non-dipping pattern may have an adverse prognosis: thus, it appears to predict the progression of renal disease, to be associated with increased target-organ damage (in some studies), and also to predict increased cardiovascular morbidity. Antihypertensive drug treatment can normalize the non-dipping pattern, but the therapeutic consequences of this are unknown."
118,10.1016/s0895-7061(99)00258-7,"Our objective was to compare three different methods of blood pressure measurement through the results of a controlled study aimed at comparing the antihypertensive effects of trandolapril and losartan. Two hundred and twenty-nine hypertensive patients were randomized in a double-blind parallel group study. After a 3-week placebo period, they received either 2 mg trandolapril or 50 mg losartan once daily for 6 weeks. At the end of both placebo and active treatment periods, three methods of blood pressure measurement were used: a) office blood pressure (three consecutive measurements); b) home self blood pressure measurements (SBPM), consisting of three consecutive measurements performed at home in the morning and in the evening for 7 consecutive days; and c) ambulatory blood pressure measurements (ABPM), 24-h BP recordings with three measurements per hour. Of the 229 patients, 199 (87%) performed at least 12 valid SBPM measurements during both placebo and treatment periods, whereas only 160 (70%) performed good quality 24-h ABPM recordings during both periods (P < .0001). One hundred-forty patients performed the three methods of measurement well. At baseline and with treatment, agreement between office measurements and ABPM or SBPM was weak. Conversely, there was a good agreement between ABPM and SBPM. The mean difference (SBP/DBP) between ABPM and SBPM was 4.6 +/- 10.4/3.5 +/- 7.1 at baseline and 3.5 +/- 10.0/4.0 +/- 7.0 at the end of the treatment period. The correlation between SBPM and ABPM expressed by the r coefficient and the P values were the following: at baseline 0.79/0.70 (< 0.001/< .0001), with active treatment 0.74/0.69 (0.0001/.0001). Hourly and 24-h reproducibility of blood pressure response was quantified by the standard deviation of BP response. Compared with office blood pressure, both global and hourly SBPM responses exhibited a lower standard deviation. Hourly reproducibility of SBPM response (10.8 mm Hg/6.9 mm Hg) was lower than hourly reproducibility of ABPM response (15.6 mm Hg/11.9 mm Hg). In conclusion, SBPM was easier to perform than ABPM. There was a good agreement between these two methods whereas concordance between SBPM or ABPM and office measurements was weak. As hourly reproducibility of SBPM response is better than reproducibility of both hourly ABPM and office BP response, SBPM seems to be the most appropriate method for evaluating residual antihypertensive effect."
119,10.1097/HJH.0000000000003026,"Objective: The aim was to compare short-term and long-term reproducibilities of in-office unattended blood pressure (BP), namely automated office blood pressure (AOBP), conventionally measured attended office BP, and self-measured home BP. Methods: A multicentre, clinical study was conducted in Japan, and 287 Japanese outpatients on antihypertensive drug medication were followed-up for 1 year. Results: The intensity of drug treatment was sustained consistently throughout the study period (defined daily doses, 1.62-1.68; P = 0.12). The mean SBP differences between baseline and 1 month later, as well as baseline and 1 year later, were less than 1.5 mmHg, whereas the standard deviations of the differences for home, AOBP, and attended office measurements for the 1-year interval were 7.7, 14.5, and 15.3 mmHg, respectively. The coefficients of variation were significantly smaller for home BP than for AOBP among all patients at both 1-month and 1-year intervals (P < 0.0001). In the 1-month interval, partial correlation coefficients of home BP (r, 0.73/0.88 for systolic/diastolic measures) were significantly higher than of conventional BP (r, 0.47/0.69). However, the correlations converged to the modest level regardless of BP information (r, 0.49-0.54/0.63-0.73) when the 1-year interval was assessed. Results were confirmatory when patients on the same drug regimen (n = 167) were analysed. Conclusion: A higher reproducibility of home BP was demonstrated compared with in-office BP, including AOBP. However, the modest correlations for the 1-year interval support the importance of regular assessment of BP, regardless of in-office or home measurements for treatment of hypertension."
120,10.1101/2022.01.26.22269921,"Measuring blood pressure during pregnancy is an essential component of antenatal care, and is critical for detecting adverse conditions such as pre-eclampsia. The standard approach for measuring blood pressure is via manual auscultation by a trained expert or via an oscillometric self-inflating cuff. While both methods can provide reasonably accurate blood pressure measurements when used correctly, non-expert use can lead to significant error. Moreover, such techniques are uncomfortable and can cause bruising, pain and consequential resistance to use / low compliance. In this work, we propose a low-cost onedimensional Doppler-based method for the detection of hypertension in pregnancy. Using a sample of 653 pregnant women of Mayan descent in highland Guatemala, we recorded up to 10 minutes of 1D Doppler data of the fetus, and blood pressure from both arms using an Omron M7 oscillometric cuff. A hierarchical LSTM network with attention mechanism was trained to classify hypertension in pregnancy, producing an area under the receiveroperator curve of 0.94. A projection of the data into lower dimensions indicates hypertensive cases are located at the periphery of the distribution of the output of the distribution. This work presents the first demonstration that blood pressure can be measured using Doppler (without occlusion) and may lead to a novel class of blood pressure monitors which allow rapid blood pressure estimation from multiple body locations. Moreover, the association of the predictor with the fetal blood flow indicates that hypertension in the mother has a significant effect on the fetal blood flow."
121,10.1101/2023.06.16.23291435,"This paper introduces a novel approach to address the challenges associated with transferring blood pressure (BP) data from oscillometric devices used in self-measured BP monitoring systems. The primary objective of this study is to improve the accessibility and usability of BP data for monitoring and managing BP during pregnancy and postpartum, particularly in low-resource settings. To this end, we developed an automated image transcription technique to effectively transcribe readings from BP devices. The photos of the BP devices were captured as part of perinatal mobile health (mHealth) monitoring systems, conducted in four studies across two countries. The Guatemala Set 1 and Guatemala Set 2 datasets include the data captured by a cohort of 49 lay midwives from 1697 and 584 pregnant women carrying singletons in the second and third trimesters in rural Guatemala during routine screening. Additionally, we designed an mHealth system in Georgia for postpartum women to monitor and report their BP at home with 23 and 49 African American participants contributing to the Georgia I3 and Georgia IMPROVE projects, respectively. We developed a deep learning-based model which operates in two steps: LCD localization using the You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection model and digit recognition using a convolutional neural network-based model capable of recognizing multiple digits. We applied color correction and thresholding techniques to minimize the impact of reflection and artifacts. Three experiments were conducted based on the devices used for training the digit recognition model. Overall, our results demonstrate that the device-specific model with transfer learning and the device independent model outperformed the device-specific model without transfer learning. The mean absolute error (MAE) of image transcription on held-out test datasets using the device-independent digit recognition were 1.1 and 1.1 mmHg for systolic and diastolic BP in the Georgia IMPROVE and 1 and 0.6 mmHg in Guatemala Set 2 datasets. The MAE, far below the FDA requirement of 5 mmHg, makes the proposed model suitable for general use when used with appropriate error devices."
122,10.1001/jama.2009.1060,"Context: Hypertension is an important preventable risk factor for death among women. While several modifiable risk factors have been identified, their combined risk and distribution in the population has not been assessed. Objective: To estimate the hypothetical fraction of hypertension associated with dietary and lifestyle factors in women. Design, Setting, and Participants: Prospective cohort study of 83,882 adult women aged 27-44 years in the second Nurses’ Health Study who were free from hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer in 1991, and who had normal reported blood pressures (defined as 120/80 or less), with follow-up for incident hypertension for 14 years through 2005. We identified 6 modifiable lifestyle and dietary factors for hypertension and defined 6 low risk categories: body mass index (BMI) <25 kg/m2, a daily mean of 30 minutes of vigorous exercise, a DASH style diet, modest alcohol intake up to 10 g/day, non-narcotic analgesic use less than once per week, and intake of 400 μg/day or more of supplemental folic acid. We analyzed the association between combinations of three (normal body mass index, daily vigorous exercise, and DASH style diet), four (three low risk factors plus modest alcohol intake), five (four low risk factors plus avoidance of analgesics), and six (addition of folic acid supplements) low risk factors and the risk of developing hypertension. Main Outcome Measures: Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for incident self-reported hypertension and population attributable risks. Results: A total of 12,319 incident cases of hypertension were documented. All six modifiable factors were independently associated with the risk of developing hypertension during follow-up after also adjusting for age, race, family history of hypertension, smoking status, and use of oral contraceptives. For women who had all six low-risk factors (0.3% of the population), the hazard ratio for incident hypertension was 0.22 (95% CI, 0.10-0.51); the hypothetical population attributable risk (PAR) was 78% (95% CI, 49-90%) for women who lacked these low-risk factors. The corresponding hypothetical absolute incidence rate difference (ARD) was 8.37 cases per 1000 person-years. The PARs were 72% (95% CI, 57-82%; ARD=7.76) for 5 low risk factors (0.8% of the population), 58% (95% CI, 46-67%; ARD=6.28) for 4 low risk factors (1.6% of the population), and 53% (95% CI, 45-60%; ARD=6.02) for 3 low risk factors (3.1% of the population). BMI alone was the most powerful predictor, with BMI ≥25 kg/m2 having an adjusted PAR of 40% (95%CI, 38%-41%) compared with BMI <25 kg/m2. Conclusion: Adherence to low-risk dietary and lifestyle factors was associated with a significantly lower incidence of self-reported hypertension. Adopting low risk dietary and lifestyle factors has the potential to prevent a large proportion of new onset hypertension occurring among young women."
123,10.1111/acer.12912,"Background: The detrimental effects of chronic heavy alcohol use on the cardiovascular system are well established and broadly appreciated. Integrated cardiovascular response to an acute dose of alcohol has been less studied. This study examined the early effects of an acute dose of alcohol on the cardiovascular system, with particular emphasis on system variability and sensitivity. The goal was to begin to understand how acute alcohol disrupts dynamic cardiovascular regulatory processes prior to the development of cardiovascular disease. Methods: Healthy participants (N = 72, age 21 to 29) were randomly assigned to an alcohol, placebo, or no-alcohol control beverage condition. Beat-to-beat heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) were assessed during a low-demand cognitive task prior to and following beverage consumption. Between-group differences in neurocardiac response to an alcohol challenge (blood alcohol concentration ~ 0.06 mg/dl) were tested. Results: The alcohol beverage group showed higher average HR, lower average stroke volume, lower HR variability and BP variability, and increased vascular tone baroreflex sensitivity after alcohol consumption. No changes were observed in the placebo group, but the control group showed slightly elevated average HR and BP after beverage consumption, possibly due to juice content. At the level of the individual, an active alcohol dose appeared to disrupt the typically tight coupling between cardiovascular processes. Conclusions: A dose of alcohol quickly invoked multiple cardiovascular responses, possibly as an adaptive reaction to the acute pharmacological challenge. Future studies should assess how exposure to alcohol acutely disrupts or dissociates typically integrated neurocardiac functions.

124,10.1056/NEJM199704173361601,"Background: It is known that obesity, sodium intake, and alcohol consumption factors influence blood pressure. In this clinical trial, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, we assessed the effects of dietary patterns on blood pressure. Methods: We enrolled 459 adults with systolic blood pressures of less than 160 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressures of 80 to 95 mm Hg. For three weeks, the subjects were fed a control diet that was low in fruits, vegetables, and dairy products, with a fat content typical of the average diet in the United States. They were then randomly assigned to receive for eight weeks the control diet, a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, or a ""combination"" diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products and with reduced saturated and total fat. Sodium intake and body weight were maintained at constant levels. Results: At base line, the mean (+/-SD) systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 131.3+/-10.8 mm Hg and 84.7+/-4.7 mm Hg, respectively. The combination diet reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 5.5 and 3.0 mm Hg more, respectively, than the control diet (P<0.001 for each); the fruits-and-vegetables diet reduced systolic blood pressure by 2.8 mm Hg more (P<0.001) and diastolic blood pressure by 1.1 mm Hg more than the control diet (P=0.07). Among the 133 subjects with hypertension (systolic pressure, > or =140 mm Hg; diastolic pressure, > or =90 mm Hg; or both), the combination diet reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 11.4 and 5.5 mm Hg more, respectively, than the control diet (P<0.001 for each); among the 326 subjects without hypertension, the corresponding reductions were 3.5 mm Hg (P<0.001) and 2.1 mm Hg (P=0.003). Conclusions: A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy foods and with reduced saturated and total fat can substantially lower blood pressure. This diet offers an additional nutritional approach to preventing and treating hypertension."
125,10.1038/hr.2010.241,"Blood pressure (BP) varies according to many internal and external factors, and behavioral factors have an important role in diurnal BP variation. BP rises sharply on waking in the morning and falls during sleep at night, although it varies throughout the day and night. These changes in BP are closely related to mental and physical activities, and the sympathetic nervous system mainly contributes to the diurnal variation in BP. Other behavioral factors, such as food consumption and obesity, dietary intake of sodium, drinking and smoking habits, consumption of coffee and tea, and bathing, also affect the diurnal variation in BP. Alterations in diurnal BP variation due to behavioral factors are frequently seen in patients with hypertension and can be classified as morning hypertension, daytime hypertension and nighttime hypertension. Appropriate lifestyle modifications may normalize or improve both the level and rhythm of BP in these patients."
126,10.1016/0002-9149(87)90358-4,"Recently it was shown that blood pressure (BP) in the elderly may decrease after a meal. The pathophysiologic mechanism of this phenomenon is unknown. It has been suggested that a failure of insulin-mediated sympathetic nervous system activation plays a role. To evaluate the role of endogenous insulin, the effects of oral glucose and oral fructose loading on BP, heart rate and norepinephrine levels were studied in 10 young normotensive volunteers (YN), 10 young hypertensive patients (YH), 10 elderly normotensive volunteers (EN) and 10 elderly hypertensive patients (EH). Fructose, 75 g/300 ml of water, elicited--in contrast to the same amount of glucose--only a small increase in insulin and glucose levels. After glucose loading, mean arterial BP decreased by 17 mm Hg in the EH group (p less than 0.001), 6 mm Hg in the EN group (p less than 0.01) and 7 mm Hg in the YH group (p less than 0.001), and did not change in the YN group. After oral fructose loading, BP did not change in any group. In all groups except the YN group, the increases in norepinephrine level and heart rate after both tests were not significantly different. These findings suggest that the BP reduction after glucose loading is related to glucose-mediated factors. A failure of insulin-mediated sympathetic nervous system activation does not appear to play a major role."

Systolic blood pressure only fell after the high-carbohydrate meal, reaching a nadir 13 mmHg below baseline values (95% confidence interval of the change, -2 to -25 mmHg). Diastolic blood pressure fell by 8 mmHg at 30 min after the high-carbohydrate meal (95% confidence interval of the change, -1 to -15 mmHg) and by 5 mmHg 45 min after the high-fat meal (95% confidence interval of the change, -1 to -8 mmHg). 4.

128,10.1093/ndt/gfx340,"Changes in lifestyle and nutrition are recommended as the first-step approach to the management of hypertension by all national and international guidelines. Today, when considering nutritional factors in hypertension, almost all the attention is focused on the reduction of salt intake to improve blood pressure (BP) control. Changes in potassium intake are only briefly evoked in guidelines. Few physicians actually think about proposing to eat more foods that are high in potassium (fruits, vegetables, nuts) to better control BP. Yet, during the last 40 years, increasing evidence has accumulated demonstrating that increasing potassium intake, either with food products or with supplements, is associated with significant reductions of both systolic and diastolic BP. The hypotensive effect of potassium is particularly marked in patients with hypertension and in subjects with a very high sodium intake, suggesting that potassium counterbalances the effects of sodium. In addition, several meta-analyses have now confirmed that high potassium intake reduces the risk of stroke by ∼ 25%. Finally, increasing potassium in the diet may perhaps be beneficial for some renal patients, as post hoc analyses have suggested that a high potassium intake may retard the decline of renal function in patients with early chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages. However, high potassium intake may be risky and sometimes even dangerous in hypertensive patients with CKD stages 3-5, specifically diabetics. In this context, however, as the level of evidence remains low, more prospective clinical studies are needed. The goal of this review is to discuss the actual evidence that supports the recommendation to eat more potassium in order to better control BP in essential hypertension and to review the restrictions in CKD patients with hypertension."
129,10.14814/phy2.13381,"Epidemiological studies reveal a J-shaped association between alcohol consumption and arterial stiffness, with arterial stiffening lower among mild-to-moderate drinkers than heavy drinkers or nondrinkers. This study aimed to examine the effects of ingesting a small amount of beer, corresponding to the amount consumed per day by a mild drinker, on arterial stiffness. Eleven men (20-22 years) participated, in random order and on different days, in four separate trials. The participants each drank 200 or 350 mL of alcohol-free beer (AFB200 and AFB350) or beer (B200 and B350), and were monitored for 90 min postingestion. There were no significant changes in arterial stiffness among trials that ingested AF200 or AF350. However, among trials ingesting B200 and B350, breath alcohol concentrations increased significantly, while indexes of arterial stiffness decreased significantly for approximately 60 min: carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (B200: -0.6 ± 0.2 m/sec; B350: -0.6 ± 0.2 m/sec); brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (B200: -53 ± 18 cm/sec; B350: -57 ± 19 cm/sec); and cardio-ankle vascular index (B200: -0.4 ± 0.1 unit; B350: -0.3 ± 0.1 unit). Furthermore, AFB showed no effect on arterial stiffness, regardless of whether or not it contained sugar, and no significant difference in antioxidant capacity was found between AFB and B. This is the first study to demonstrate that acute ingestion of relatively small amounts of beer reduces arterial stiffness (for approximately 60 min). Our data also suggest that the reduction in arterial stiffness induced by ingestion of beer is largely attributable to the effects of alcohol."
130,10.1039/c0fo00166j,"Caffeine users have been encouraged to consume caffeine regularly to maintain their caffeine tolerance and so avoid caffeine's acute pressor effects. In controlled conditions complete caffeine tolerance to intervention doses of 250 mg develops rapidly following several days of caffeine ingestion, nevertheless, complete tolerance is not evident for lower intervention doses. Similarly complete caffeine tolerance to 250 mg intervention doses has been demonstrated in habitual coffee and tea drinkers' but for lower intervention doses complete tolerance is not evident. This study investigated a group of habitual caffeine users following their self-determined consumption pattern involving two to six servings daily. Cardiovascular responses following the ingestion of low to moderate amounts caffeine (67, 133 and 200 mg) were compared with placebo in a double-blind, randomised design without caffeine abstinence. Pre-intervention and post-intervention (30 and 60 min) 90 s continuous cardiovascular recordings were obtained with the Finometer in both the supine and upright postures. Participants were 12 healthy habitual coffee and tea drinkers (10 female, mean age 36). Doses of 67 and 133 mg increased systolic pressure in both postures while in the upright posture diastolic pressure and aortic impedance increased while arterial compliance decreased. These vascular changes were larger upright than supine for 133 mg caffeine. Additionally 67 mg caffeine increased dp/dt and indexed peripheral resistance in the upright posture. For 200 mg caffeine there was complete caffeine tolerance. Cardiovascular responses to caffeine appear to be associated with the size of the intervention dose. Habitual tea and coffee drinking does not generate complete tolerance to caffeine as has been previously suggested. Both the type and the extent of caffeine induced cardiovascular changes were influenced by posture."
131,10.1152/ajpendo.00674.2010,"Acute alcohol consumption is reported to decrease mean arterial pressure (MAP) during orthostatic challenge, a response that may contribute to alcohol-mediated syncope. Muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) increases during orthostatic stress to help maintain MAP, yet the effects of alcohol on MSNA responses during orthostatic stress have not been determined. We hypothesized that alcohol ingestion would blunt arterial blood pressure and MSNA responses to lower body negative pressure (LBNP). MAP, MSNA, and heart rate (HR) were recorded during progressive LBNP (−5, −10, −15, −20, −30, and −40 mmHg; 3 min/stage) in 30 subjects (age 24 ± 1 yr). After an initial progressive LBNP (pretreatment), subjects consumed either alcohol (0.8 g ethanol/kg body mass; n = 15) or placebo (n = 15), and progressive LBNP was repeated (posttreatment). Alcohol increased resting HR (59 ± 2 to 65 ± 2 beats/min, P < 0.05), MSNA (13 ± 3 to 19 ± 4 bursts/min, P < 0.05), and MSNA burst latency (1,313 ± 16 to 1,350 ± 17 ms, P < 0.05) compared with placebo (group × treatment interactions, P < 0.05). During progressive LBNP, a pronounced decrease in MAP was observed after alcohol but not placebo (group × time × treatment, P < 0.05). In contrast, MSNA and HR increased during all LBNP protocols, but there were no differences between trials or groups. However, alcohol altered MSNA burst latency response to progressive LBNP. In conclusion, the lack of MSNA adjustment to a larger drop in arterial blood pressure during progressive LBNP, coupled with altered sympathetic burst latency responses, suggests that alcohol blunts MSNA responses to orthostatic stress."

The subjects divided into 4 groups, which consumed three portions of noni or chokeberry juices (30 mL or 200 mL, respectively) and energy drink (ED) or water (200 mL) at one-hour intervals. All participants had their blood pressure (BP), both systolic and diastolic BP (SBP and DBP), as well as heart rate (HR) and blood glucose (BG), measured. Consumption of noni juice caused a significant decrease in SBP and DBP of 5.0% and 7.5%, respectively, while, the consumption of chokeberry juice slightly decreased only DBP by 3.6%. On the contrary, consumption of three portions of EDs caused a significant increase in DBP by 14.7%. The BG of participants consuming noni juice decreased by 7.3%, while the consumption of EDs increased BG by as much as 15.8%. Acute consumption of noni juice contributed to a significantly decreased SBP, DBP, and HR as well as a mild reduction of BG. Consumption of chokeberry juice caused only a slight reduction of DBP. Contrary to juices, EDs consumption resulted in an increase of blood pressure (especially DBP) and blood glucose. The results of the study showed that noni juice may be effective in lowering blood pressure and blood sugar levels, but there is a need to continue research on the long-term effect of this juice."

134,10.1016/b978-0-444-59427-3.00019-8,"Epidemiological studies show that adverse cardiovascular events peak in the morning (i.e., between 6 AM and noon) and that shift work is associated with cardiovascular disease, obesity, and diabetes. The endogenous circadian timing system modulates certain cardiovascular risk markers to be highest (e.g., cortisol, nonlinear dynamic heart rate control, and platelet activation) or to respond most unfavorably to stressors such as exercise (e.g., epinephrine, norepinephrine, and vagal cardiac modulation) at an internal body time corresponding to the time of day when adverse cardiovascular events most likely occur. This indicates that the circadian timing system and its interaction with external cardiovascular stressors (e.g., physical activity) could contribute to the morning peak in adverse cardiovascular events. Moreover, circadian misalignment and simulated night work have adverse effects on cardiovascular and metabolic function. This suggests that misalignment between the behavioral cycle and the circadian timing system in shift workers contributes to that population's increased risk for cardiometabolic disease."
135,10.1096/fj.12-203554,"In the past decade, it has become increasingly evident that the circadian clock system plays an important role in many physiological processes. The circadian clock can be divided into 2 parts: the central clock, residing in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus, which receives light cues, and the peripheral clocks that reside in various tissues throughout the body. The peripheral clocks play an integral and unique role in each of their respective tissues, driving the circadian expression of specific genes involved in a variety of physiological functions. The goal of this review is to provide an introduction to and overview of the peripheral clocks, including potential mechanisms, targets, and implications for disease states.

Entrainment, or alignment, of circadian rhythmicity is dependent upon time of day and can occur through environmental influences such as light cues and physical activity exerted on skeletal muscle. Entrainment of the circadian clock through exercise has been reported to improve health by reducing risk of conditions such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), but further research is still needed. The purpose of this review is to discuss the effects exercise has on the regulation of circadian rhythmicity, specifically with respect to CVD risk factors – including hormonal levels, sleep/wake cycles, blood pressure, and heart rate.

137,10.1093/ajh/hpu001,"Background: Home blood pressure measurement (HBPM) is recommended for the diagnosis and follow-up of hypertensive patients. While measurement protocols emphasize a rest period before taking the measurement, this directive has not been supported by any specific study to date. This analysis aimed to determine whether the respect or nonrespect of rest before HBPM could introduce a difference between daytime ambulatory blood pressure measurement (ABPM) and HBPM; whether this rest is observed ""in real life"" among educated hypertensive patients. Methods: In this open, prospective study we compared HBPM, with and without rest, and ABPM among 52 office/clinically controlled hypertensive patients. HBPM was performed during 3 days (French HAS instructions); 24-hour ABPM was performed within 3 days of HBPM. All patients who regularly performed HBPM before the study were asked how they practiced HBPM in real life. Results: There was a differential impact of rest on differences observed in daytime ABPM and HBPM. Systolic HBPM decreased with rest, while diastolic HBPM did not significantly increase. HBPM systolic BP (SBP) without rest was not significantly different from daytime ABPM SBP (P = 0.27). HBPM SBP without rest was lower than daytime and 24-hour systolic ABPM. Diastolic HBPM after rest was not significantly different from daytime diastolic ABPM (P = 0.09). None of the 38 patients who regularly performed HBPM were compliant with a period of rest before beginning the measurements."
138,10.1111/jch.13762,"Epidemiologic studies have consistently demonstrated an increased risk of cardiovascular disease during colder temperatures. Hemodynamic changes associated with cold temperature and an increase in thrombogenicity may both account for the increase in cardiovascular risk and mortality. Studies using both in-office and out-of-office BP measurements have consistently shown an elevation in BP during the colder seasons. The large difference in BP between cold and warm months may increase the incidence of hypertension and reduce the hypertension control rate, potentially resulting in increased cardiovascular risk, especially among those at risk of cardiovascular disease. The current trends in global warming and climate change may have a profound impact on the epidemiology of hypertension and cardiovascular disease, as changes in the climate may significantly affect both BP variability and cardiovascular disease, especially in those with high cardiovascular risk and the elderly. Furthermore, climate change could have a significant influence on hypertension in Asia, considering the unique characteristics of hypertensive patients in Asia. As an increase in ambient temperature decreases the mean daytime average and morning surge in BP, but increases the nocturnal BP, it is difficult to predict how environmental changes will affect the epidemiology and prognosis of hypertension in the Asian-Pacific region. However, these seasonal variations in BP could be minimized by adjusting the housing conditions and using anticipation medicine. In this review, we discuss the impact of seasonal variation in the ambient temperature on hypertension and cardiovascular disease and discuss how this may impact the epidemiology of hypertension and cardiovascular disease."
139,10.1097/00004872-199816110-00004,"Clinic blood pressure values are known to change according to seasonal influences. We therefore examined home and 24 h ambulatory blood pressure values to determine whether these measurements are also affected by the seasons.

Because the overall sample was evenly distributed over each month (except August), we were able to make a cross-sectional determination of whether the values differed between seasons. The corresponding heart rates were also evaluated. 
As expected, summer was associated with the lowest clinic blood pressure and winter with the highest, and this was the case also for home and 24 h average blood pressure, although seasonal differences in the latter were less pronounced. Seasonal clinic, home and ambulatory blood pressure patterns were similar for normotensive subjects (n = 1152), untreated hypertensives (n = 540) and treated hypertensives (n = 359). Heart rate values did not differ by season.
Seasonal influences on blood pressure are not limited to conventional measurements but characterize daily values as well. These effects are visible in both normal and elevated blood pressure values, regardless of the effect of antihypertensive drugs. This has implications both for the clinician and for studies aimed at evaluating the effects of antihypertensive treatment."
140,10.1038/sj.jhh.1001134,"The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of ambient temperature on blood pressure (BP). BP measurements were taken in 20 normotensive volunteers who stayed in Greenland for a 6-week period. Measurements of systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP) and heart rate (HR) were taken before (3 sessions), during (7-8 sessions) and after the journey (3 sessions). Each session consisted of five BP measurements in the supine position after at least 5 min rest. All five readings were averaged. Temperature data (mean +/- s.d.), collected from meteorological services, before, during and after Greenland were 15.7 +/- 0.6, 0.5 +/- 1.5 and 8.2 +/- 0.8 degrees C. SBP values were 116 +/- 7.0, 122 +/- 7.6 and 116 +/- 7.4 and DBP 63 +/- 5.2, 66 +/- 5.8 and 65 +/- 6.5 mm Hg, respectively. HR amounted to 58 +/- 7.4, 61 +/- 6.7 and 60 +/- 7.4 bpm. Significant differences existed between, before and during for SBP and DBP and between, during and after for SBP. Readings were grouped in four categories based on the temperature at the time of reading. For SBP as well as DBP a clear dose-response relationship was demonstrated between low temperature and high BP, although for DBP only a few correlations were statistically significant. Mean correlation coefficients for SBP and DBP against temperature were -0.44 (P < 0.001) and -0.27 (P < 0.005), respectively. our results are in favour of a moderate, but both significant and relevant increase in sbp and dbp when moving from higher to lower ambient temperature."
141,10.1093/eurheartj/ehv023,"Blood pressure is a major cause of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and both may increase as outdoor temperatures fall. However, there are still limited data about seasonal variation in blood pressure and CVD mortality among patients with prior-CVD.
We analysed data on 23 000 individuals with prior-CVD who were recruited from 10 diverse regions into the China Kadoorie Biobank during 2004-8. After 7 years of follow-up, 1484 CVD deaths were recorded. Baseline survey data were used to assess seasonal variation in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and its association with outdoor temperature. Cox regression was used to examine the association of usual SBP with subsequent CVD mortality, and seasonal variation in CVD mortality was assessed by Poisson regression. All analyses were adjusted for age, sex, and region.
Mean SBP was significantly higher in winter than in summer (145 vs. 136 mmHg, P < 0.001), especially among those without central heating. Above 5°C, each 10°C lower outdoor temperature was associated with 6.2 mmHg higher SBP. Systolic blood pressure predicted subsequent CVD mortality, with each 10 mmHg higher usual SBP associated with 21% (95% confidence interval: 16-27%) increased risk. Cardiovascular disease mortality varied by season, with 41% (21-63%) higher risk in winter compared with summer.
Among adult Chinese with prior-CVD, there is both increased blood pressure and CVD mortality in winter. Careful monitoring and more aggressive blood pressure lowering treatment in the cold months are needed to help reduce the winter excess CVD mortality in high-risk individuals."

However, whether exposures to temperature and air pollution simultaneously may have interactive effects on BP has been unknown. We investigated this potential interaction during 460 repeated visits in 39 healthy university students in the context of traffic-related air pollution.
Study participants in the Healthy Volunteer Natural Relocation study underwent repeated BP measurements for 12 occasions under three exposure scenarios in Beijing, China, in 2010-2011. We used generalized linear mixed-effects models to estimate exposure effects.
Decreasing temperature was associated with significant increases in BP. There were significant interactions between temperature and traffic-related air pollutants (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 μm, organic carbon, elemental carbon and nitrogen dioxide) on BP (P < 0.05 for all interaction tests). The estimated increases in SBP and DBP were 4.9 mmHg [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.9-6.8] and 3.7 mmHg (95% CI 2.3-5.1) at high elemental carbon level (≥median), and were -1.3 mmHg (95% CI -6.3 to 3.6) and 0.7 mmHg (95% CI -2.8 to 4.2) at low elemental carbon level (<median) per 10°C decrease in daily minimum temperature. We also found stronger air pollution effects on BP at low temperature levels (<median) than at high temperature levels (≥median).
Low temperature and high air pollution may act synergistically to increase BP in healthy adults. Our findings may have potential implications for prevention of cardiovascular events associated with increased BP among high-risk individuals."

Repeated measurements of the indoor temperature, relative humidity, body temperature, and blood pressure were conducted for 20 elderly individuals living in low-cost dosshouses in Seoul during hot summer days in 2010. Changes in the body temperature, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) according to variations in the indoor and outdoor temperature and humidity were analyzed using a repeated-measures ANOVA controlling for age, sex, alcohol, and smoking.
Average indoor and outdoor temperatures were 31.47℃ (standard deviation [SD], 0.97℃) and 28.15℃ (SD, 2.03℃), respectively. Body temperature increased by 0.21℃ (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.16 to 0.26℃) and 0.07℃ (95% CI, 0.04 to 0.10℃) with an increase in the indoor and outdoor temperature of 1℃. DBP decreased by 2.05 mmHg (95% CI, 0.05 to 4.05 mmHg), showing a statistical significance, as the indoor temperature increased by 1℃, while it increased by 0.20 mmHg (95% CI, -0.83 to 1.22 mmHg) as outdoor temperature increased by 1℃. SBP decreased by 1.75 mmHg (95% CI, -1.11 to 4.61 mmHg) and 0.35 mmHg (95% CI, -1.04 to 1.73 mmHg), as the indoor and outdoor temperature increased by 1℃, respectively. The effects of relative humidity on SBP and DBP were not statistically significant for both indoor and outdoor.

We investigated the relevance of incorrect cuff positioning during (1) auscultatory measurement with an appropriate or improperly small cuff and (2) oscillometric measurement with a wide-range cuff designed to guarantee accurate measurements regardless of position. In subjects with wide BP and arm circumference ranges, (1) auscultatory BP was repeatedly measured with a properly positioned cuff (reference) and, simultaneously, with an identical cuff placed on the other arm in either a correct or an incorrect position (test). The measurements were performed with a properly sized (N=57) or an improperly small cuff (N=33). (2) Auscultatory measurements obtained with a properly positioned and sized cuff were compared with oscillometric measurements obtained with a specially designed wide-range cuff (Omron IntelliWrap) placed on the contralateral arm either in a correct or an incorrect position. Auscultatory BP measures were unaffected by incorrect positioning of a properly sized cuff, whereas with undercuffing, BP was overestimated with the cuff displaced by 90° laterally (systolic/diastolic BP differences: 4.9±4.6/4.0±4.6 mm Hg, P<0.01) or by 180° (3.9±5.4/4.2±5.1 mm Hg, P<0.01) in relation to the correct position. Incorrect placement of the oscillometric cuff had no significant effect on the accuracy of the measurements (difference with correct position <1.5 mm Hg). Incorrect cuff positioning introduces a systematic overestimation of auscultatory BP when the cuff is too small in relation to arm circumference but not when it is correctly sized. No systematic error was observed with oscillometric measurements obtained with a specially designed wide-range cuff"
145,10.1007/s00421-010-1646-9,"Gravity, like any acceleration, causes a hydrostatic pressure gradient in fluid-filled bodily compartments. At a force of 1G, this pressure gradient amounts to 10 kPa/m. Postural changes alter the distribution of hydrostatic pressure patterns according to the body's alignment to the acceleration field. At a certain location--referred to as hydrostatically indifferent--within any given fluid compartment, pressure remains constant during a given change of position relative to the acceleration force acting upon the body. At this specific location, there is probably little change in vessel volume, wall tension, and the balance of Starling forces after a positional manoeuvre. In terms of cardiac function, this is important because arterial and venous hydrostatic indifference locations determine postural cardiac preload and afterload changes. Baroreceptors pick up pressure signals that depend on their respective distance to hydrostatic indifference locations with any change of body position. Vascular shape, filling volume, and compliance, as well as temperature, nervous and endocrine factors, drugs, and time all influence hydrostatic indifference locations. This paper reviews the physiology of pressure gradients in the cardiovascular system that are operational in a gravitational/acceleration field, offers a broadened hydrostatic indifference concept, and discusses implications that are relevant in physiological and clinical terms."

One of the key obstacles in the further development of wearable sensors for medical applications is the lack of comprehensive technical evaluation of sensor materials against the expected clinical performance. Here, we present an extensive review and critical analysis of various materials applied in the design and fabrication of wearable sensors. In our unique transdisciplinary approach, we studied the fundamentals of blood pressure and examined its measuring modalities while focusing on their clinical use and sensing principles to identify material functionalities. Then, we carefully reviewed various categories of functional materials utilized in sensor building blocks allowing for comparative analysis of the performance of a wide range of materials throughout the sensor operational-life cycle. Not only this provides essential data to enhance the materials' properties and optimize their performance, but also, it highlights new perspectives and provides suggestions to develop the next generation pressure sensors for clinical use."

To test whether there is any difference between the blood pressure readings with patients sitting and supine.
Blood pressure and heart rate were measured three times each for 245 subjects (171 hypertensives), with subjects both sitting and supine, simultaneously on both arms, with a Hawksley random-zero sphygmomanometer on the right arm and a semi-automatic oscillometric device (Bosomat) on the left arm. The sequence of the two positions was randomized. The procedure was repeated on a second occasion for 49 subjects (41 hypertensives) with the sequence of the positions reversed. Because there was no systematic difference among the three readings per position, the averages of the three blood pressure and heart rate readings with subjects sitting and supine were compared and the influences of age, body mass index, hypertension and medication on the difference were examined. We found no influence of the subject's body posture on the systolic blood pressure. We found a higher diastolic blood pressure [by 5.2+/-0.4 mmHg (mean+/-SEM), P< 0.001 with Hawksley random-zero sphygmomanometer] and a greater heart rate [by 1.5+/-0.3 beats/min (mean+/-SEM), P< 0.001] with subjects sitting. The sitting minus supine differences for diastolic blood pressure and heart rate decreased significantly with increasing age (P< 0.001). We found no effect of body mass index, hypertension and medication on the sitting - supine differences.
The subject's body posture influenced especially the diastolic blood pressure and heart rate, both of them being significantly higher with patients sitting rather than supine. This effect decreased with age. Thus, for indirect blood pressure measurement, diastolic blood pressure values obtained with subjects sitting and supine cannot automatically be regarded as equivalent."
151,10.1038/ajh.2011.106,"Although blood pressure (BP) differences from supine to sitting position have long been recognized, limited data are available on other commonly used body positions. We performed a cross-sectional study to compare BP values obtained in supine, sitting, and Fowler's positions in essential hypertensive subjects.Systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) were recorded using an automatic oscillometric device. Nine measurements were taken: three measurements, in random order, in supine, Fowler's, and sitting position. Two generalized estimating equations models were used to evaluate potential predictors of SBP and DBP adjusting for heart rate and measurement order.
The sample consisted of 250 subjects (mean age 66.3 ± 13.4 years; 44.4% males). Measured in supine, Fowler's, and sitting position, mean SBPs were 139.3 ± 14.0; 138.1 ± 13.8; 137.2 ± 13.7 mm Hg, respectively, and mean DBPs 80.1 ± 9.1; 81.9 ± 9.4; 83.0 ± 9.6 mm Hg, respectively. At multivariate analysis, mean SBP significantly decreased if measured in Fowler's and sitting positions, as compared to supine. In contrast, DBP significantly increased. A relevant proportion of subjects showed large differences (≤ or ≥10 mm Hg) in mean SBP across positions: i.e., 30.0% comparing supine vs. sitting SBP. An even higher prevalence of large differences was observed according to the measurement order within the same positions, with no univocal direction (random variation).
 Fowler's position may represent a valid alternative to sitting and supine positions for BP measurement in clinical practice.

Mean +/- SD inter-arm differences in systolic and diastolic blood pressure were 1.81 +/- 8.6 mmHg and -0.23 +/- 8.3 mmHg, respectively. The analogous figures for mean +/- SD absolute differences were 6.32 +/- 6.12 mmHg and 5.06 +/- 6.57 mmHg, respectively. Significant differences were present between the mean right and left arm systolic blood pressure [t(399) = 4.20, P < 0.0001], and the mean absolute difference for both systolic [t(399) = 20.65; P < 0.0001] and diastolic [t(399) = 15.39; P < 0.0001] blood pressure. The variation in mean inter-arm blood pressure was unrelated to age, sex, ethnicity, arm circumference, handedness, being hypertensive, diabetic, or previous history of cardiovascular disease. Clinically significant inter-arm differences in systolic blood pressure of > 10 and > 20 mmHg were found in 20 and 3.5%, respectively; diastolic differences of > 10 and > 20 mmHg were present in 11 and 3.5%, respectively.

Overall, 1,494 pairs of simultaneous oscillometric and invasive blood pressure measurements were collected in 38 patients (group I, n = 5; group II, n = 23; and group III, n = 10) over a total time of 72.3 hrs. Mean arterial blood pressure ranged from 35 to 165 mm Hg. The overall discrepancy between oscillometric and invasive blood pressure measurement was -6.7+/-9.7 mm Hg (p<.0001), if the recommended cuff size according to the upper-arm circumference was used (539 measurements). Of all the blood pressure measurements, 26.4% (n = 395) had a discrepancy of > or =10 mm Hg and 34.2% (n = 512) exhibited a discrepancy of > or =20 mm Hg. No differences between invasive and noninvasive blood pressure measurements were noted in patients either with or without inotropic support (-6.6 + 7.2 vs. -8.6 + 6.8 mm Hg; not significant). The oscillometric blood pressure measurement significantly underestimates arterial blood pressure and exhibits a high number of measurements out of the clinically acceptable range. The relation between cuff size and upper-arm circumference contributes substantially to the inaccuracy of the oscillometric blood pressure measurement. Therefore, oscillometric blood pressure measurement does not achieve adequate accuracy in critically ill patients."
162,10.1111/jch.13301,"The characteristics of the optimal cuff for blood pressure (BP) measurement are still the subject of much debate. The choice of the appropriate cuff in obese individuals depends not only on the arm circumference but also on its shape because a conically shaped arm makes it difficult to fit the cuff to the arm. When a large-size cylindrical cuff is used in conical arms, an overestimation of the true BP is likely to occur with BP discrepancies that may be as large as 10 mm Hg. With the advent of automatic oscillometric devices, the choice of the appropriate cuff became even more controversial because with oscillometric BP measurement the reference point is not the artery occlusion but the oscillometric peak signal. To overcome the problem of miscuffing in obese individuals, special cuffs that can accommodate a wide range of arm sizes have been designed. Using these cuffs, accurate oscillometric BP measurements can be obtained over a wide range of arm circumferences using a unique software algorithm. These wide-range cuffs coupled to oscillometric devices may represent a good option for BP measurement in very obese subjects. However, their reliability should be confirmed in larger populations and different settings."
164,10.1038/jhh.2013.38,"Office blood pressure (BP) is recommended to be measured after 5 min of seated rest, but it may decrease for 10 min of seated rest. This study aimed to determine the change (and its clinical relevance) in brachial and central BP from 5 to 10 min of seated rest. Office brachial and central BP (measured after 5 and 10 min), left ventricular (LV) mass index, 7-day home and ambulatory BP were measured in 250 participants with treated hypertension. Office brachial and central BP were significantly lower at 10-min compared with 5-min BP (P<0.001). Seven-day home systolic BP (SBP) was significantly lower than office SBP measured at 5 min (P<0.001), but was similar to office SBP at 10 min (P=0.511). From 5 to 10 min, the percentage of participants with controlled BP increased and the percentage of participants with high central pulse pressure (PP) decreased (P<0.001). Moreover, brachial and central PP were significantly correlated with LV mass index measured at 10 min (r=0.171, P=0.006 and r=0.139, P=0.027, respectively), but not at 5 min (r=0.115, P=0.068 and r=0.084, P=0.185, respectively). BP recorded after 10 min is more representative of true BP control. These findings have relevance to appropriate diagnosis of hypertension and design of clinical trials."
165,10.1016/j.amjhyper.2005.08.021,"Background: The optimal time at rest before clinic blood pressure (BP) measurement is still undefined. In this study in patients with essential hypertension, the time course of the hemodynamic changes during a 16-min rest in the chair-seated position was evaluated and compared with that observed in a stabilized postural condition, such as after a prolonged supine rest.
Methods: In 55 untreated essential hypertensive patients, BP, heart rate, stroke volume (impedance cardiography), and systemic vascular resistances were measured every other minute during a 16-min rest in the chair-seated position and, in random sequence, in the last 16 min of a 60-min supine rest.
Results: Overall, systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) decreased by 11.6 and 4.3 mm Hg, respectively, during the chair-seated rest; only a 1.8–mm Hg decrease in SBP was observed in the control supine study. The chair-seated fall in BP was associated with a decrease in systemic vascular resistances, in the absence of significant changes in cardiac index. From the logarithmic curve of SBP and DBP decrements, a half-time of 5.8 and 5.5 min respectively, was calculated. Decrements in SBP, but not DBP, were inversely related to the corresponding baseline values.
Conclusions: In untreated essential hypertensive patients a significant decrease in SBP and DBP associated with a systemic vasodilation was observed during a 16-min rest in the chair-seated position. Because approximately 75% of the spontaneous fall in BP occurred within 10 min, it appears that this time at rest before clinic BP evaluation could improve the precision and accuracy of the measurement."

In almost all the 48 normotensive and hypertensive subjects tested the doctor's arrival at the bedside induced immediate rises in systolic and diastolic blood pressures peaking within 1 to 4 min (mean 26·7±2·3 mm Hg and 14·9±1·6 mm Hg above pre-visit values). There were large differences between individuals in the peak response (range, 4-75 mm Hg systolic and 1-36 mm Hg diastolic) unrelated to age, sex, baseline blood pressure, or blood-pressure variability. There was concomitant tachycardia (average peak response 15·9±1·5 beats/min, range 4-45 beats/min) which was only slightly correlated with the blood-pressure rise. After the peak response blood pressure declined and at the end ofthe visit was only slightly above the pre-visit level. A second visit by the same doctor did not change the average size of the early pressor response or the slope of its subsequent decline."
167,10.1016/j.jash.2008.04.002,"This American Society of Hypertension position paper focuses on the importance of out-of-office blood pressure (BP) measurement for the clinical management of patients with hypertension and its complications. Studies have supported direct and independent associations of cardiovascular risk with ambulatory BP and inverse associations with the degree of BP reduction from day to night. Self-monitoring of the BP (or home BP monitoring) also has advantages in evaluating patients with hypertension, especially those already on drug treatment, but less is known about its relation to future cardiovascular events. Data derived from ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) allow the identification of high-risk patients, independent from the BP obtained in the clinic or office setting. While neither ABPM nor self-BP monitoring are mandatory for the routine diagnosis of hypertension, these modalities can enhance the ability for identification of white-coat and masked hypertension and evaluate the extent of BP control in patients on drug therapy."
168,10.3390/technologies5020021,"Blood pressure (BP) is one of the most important monitoring parameters in clinical medicine. For years, the cuff-based sphygmomanometer and the arterial invasive line have been the gold standards for care professionals to assess BP. During the past few decades, the wide spread of the oscillometry-based BP arm or wrist cuffs have made home-based BP assessment more convenient and accessible. However, the discontinuous nature, the inability to interface with mobile applications, the relative inaccuracy with movement, and the need for calibration have rendered those BP oscillometry devices inadequate for next-generation healthcare infrastructure where integration and continuous data acquisition and communication are required. Recently, the indirect approach to obtain BP values has been intensively investigated, where BP is mathematically derived through the “Time Delay” in propagation of pressure waves in the vascular system. This holds promise for the realization of cuffless and continuous BP monitoring systems, for both patients and healthy populations in both inpatient and outpatient settings. This review highlights recent efforts in developing these next-generation blood pressure monitoring devices and compares various mathematical models. The unmet challenges and further developments that are crucial to develop “Time Delay”-based BP devices are also discussed."
170,10.1109%2FTBME.2017.2756018,"Objective: Pulse transit time (PTT) is being widely pursued for ubiquitous blood pressure (BP) monitoring. PTT-based systems may require periodic cuff calibrations but can still be useful for hypertension screening by affording numerous, out-of-clinic measurements that can be averaged. The objective was to predict the maximum calibration period that would not compromise accuracy and acceptable error limits in light of measurement averaging for PTT-based systems. Methods: Well-known mathematical models and vast BP data were leveraged. Models relating PTT, age, and gender to BP were employed to determine the maximum time period for the PTT-BP calibration curve to change by <1 mmHg over physiological BP ranges for each age and gender. A model of within-person BP variability was employed to establish the screening accuracy of the conventional cuff-based approach. These models were integrated to investigate the screening accuracy of the average of numerous measurements of a PTT-based system in relation to the accuracy of its individual measurements. Results: The maximum calibration period was about 1 year for a 30 year old and declined linearly to about 6 months for a 70 year old. A PTT-based system with precision error of >12 mmHg for systolic BP could achieve the screening accuracy of the cuff-based approach via measurement averaging. Conclusion: This theoretical study indicates that PTT-based BP monitoring is viable even with periodic calibration and seemingly high measurement errors. Significance: The predictions may help guide the implementation, evaluation, and application of PTT-based BP monitoring systems in practice.

171,10.3390/s130404714,"A prototype of a clip-type pulsimeter equipped with a magnetic field-sensing semiconductor Hall sensor was developed. It has a permanent magnet attached in the “Chwan” position to the center of a radial artery. The clip-type pulsimeter is composed of a hardware system measuring voltage signals. To measure spatial pulse wave velocity (SPWV), the signal from the radial artery pulsimeter and that from the photoplethysmography (PPG) were simultaneously compared. The pulse wave data from a clinical test of 39 clinical participants (male:female = 25:14) with a mean age of 24.36 (±2.35) years was analyzed. The mean SPWV, which was simultaneously measured from the radial artery pulsimeter and PPG, was 0.8 m/s. We suggest the SPWV results were higher for men than women, because of the better vascularity of terminal tissue in men. The findings of this research may be useful for developing a biomedical signal storage device for a U-health-care system."
172,10.4236/jbise.2016.910B004 ,"Continuous non-invasive blood pressure (BP) measurement can be realized by using pulse transit time (PTT) based on electrocardiogram (ECG) and pulse wave signal. Modulated magnetic signature of blood (MMSB) is a promising approach to obtain PTT. The origin of MMSB is critical to establish the relationship between MMSB and BP. In this paper, two possible origins of MMSB, blood disturbance mechanism and angular variation mechanism, are analyzed and verified through three control experi-ments under different conditions. The influence of blood velocity alteration and blood volume alteration on magnetic field is investigated though blood flow simulation sys-tem. It is found that MMSB comes mainly from the periodic blood flow while the per-turbation caused by angular variation between sensitive axis of the magnetic sensor and geomagnetic field can be neglected. As to blood disturbance mechanism, the change of blood volume plays a decisive role while the effect of blood velocity altera-tion is negligible."
173,10.1109/embc.2013.6610029,"A new all optical method for long term and continuous blood pressure measurement and monitoring without using cuffs is proposed by using Ballistocardiography (BCG) and Photoplethysmograph (PPG). Based on BCG signal and PPG signal, a time delay between these two signals is obtained to calculate both systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure via linear regression analysis. The fabricated noninvasive blood pressure monitoring device consists of a fiber sensor mat to measure BCG signal and a SpO2 sensor to measure PPG signal. A commercial digital oscillometric blood pressure meter is used to obtain reference values and for calibration. It has been found that by comparing with the reference device, our prototype has typical means and standard deviations of 9+/-5.6 mmHg for systolic blood pressure, 1.8+/-1.3 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure and 0.6+/-0.9 bpm for pulse rate, respectively. If the fiber optic SpO2 probe is used, this new all fiber cuffless noninvasive blood pressure monitoring device will truly be a MRI safe blood pressure measurement and monitoring device."
174,10.3390/s17051176,"In the last decade, cuffless blood pressure measurement technology has been widely studied because it could be applied to a wearable apparatus. Electrocardiography (ECG), photo-plethysmography (PPG), and phonocardiography are always used to detect the pulse transit time (PTT) because the changed tendencies of the PTT and blood pressure have a negative relationship. In this study, the PPG signal was replaced by the impedance plethysmography (IPG) signal and was used to detect the PTT. The placement and direction of the electrode array for the IPG measurement were discussed. Then, we designed an IPG ring that could measure an accurate IPG signal. Twenty healthy subjects participated in this study. The changes in blood pressure after exercise were evaluated through the changes of the PTT. The results showed that the change of the systolic pressure had a better relationship with the change of the PTTIPG than that of the PTTPPG (r = 0.700 vs. r = 0.450). Moreover, the IPG ring with spot electrodes would be more suitable to develop with the wearable cuffless blood pressure monitor than the PPG sensor."

In the process of model construction, the mean impact value method was introduced to investigate the impact of each feature on the models and the genetic algorithm was introduced to implement parameter optimization. The experimental results showed that the proposed models could effectively describe the nonlinear relationship between the features and BP and had higher accuracy than the traditional methods with the error of 3.27 ± 5.52 mmHg for systolic BP and 1.16 ± 1.97 mmHg for diastolic BP. Moreover, the estimation errors met the requirements of the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation and British Hypertension Society criteria. In conclusion, this study was helpful in promoting the practical application of methods for non-invasive continuous BP estimation models."
176,10.1016/j.bspc.2018.08.022,"Background and objective: Blood pressure (BP) is one of the four vital signals that provides valuable medical
information about the cardiovascular activity. In recent years, extensive studies have been conducted
on non-invasive and cuff-less BP estimation using photoplethysmography (PPG) signals. PPG is a noninvasive
optical method for measuring blood volume changes per pulse. In other words, the PPG waveform
represents the mechanical activity of the heart.
Methods: In this paper, a new method for estimating the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP), Diastolic Blood
Pressure (DBP) and Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) is proposed using only the PPG signal regardless of its
shape (appropriate or inappropriate). Our proposed algorithm called whole-based, uses raw values of
the PPG signal at a given time interval for estimating the BP. In other algorithms called parameter-based,
use features which are extracted from PPG signals in time or frequency domain. These features related
to precise spotting in the form of the PPG signal. In fact, compared to parameter-based methods, our
algorithm is independent of the form of the PPG signal.
Results: Using the proposed algorithm, our results are completely met by the Association for the Advancement
of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) standard for both MAP and DBP estimations. The results are
also very close to the standard boundary with an average error close to zero for SBP estimation. Also,
according to the British Hypertension Society (BHS) standard, the proposed algorithm for DBP estimation
got grade A, whereas it got grade B for estimation of MAP and got approximately grade C for SBP
estimation.
Conclusion: The results demonstrate the applicability of the proposed algorithm in estimating BP noninvasively,
cuff-less, calibration-free, and only by using the appropriate or inappropriate PPG signal."

It is equally important to recognize that all public-use BP kiosks are not equivalent. Members of the AAMI Sphygmomanometer Committee and other ‘‘concerned citizens’’ are working with FDA officials to try to improve both device validation and cuff range performance of these devices. In reality, regulatory changes will be slow to take effect, and for the foreseeable future, the burden of device accuracy assessment lies with the private sector and the public. There is a device currently available that has undergone full validation testing and offers a wide-range cuff validated for almost all US adult arms. We recognize the importance of innovation in out-of-office BP measurement. Therefore, in the interest of public health, we strongly urge those business professionals buying such devices, and those health professionals advising patients on their use, to become better informed and more discriminant in their device selection."

It relies on the installation of measurement devices, which placement is an open challenge for developers. In this paper, a sparse sampling method using a Gaussian Mixture Model on Numerical Weather Prediction data is developed for the offshore wind reconstruction. It is applied on France's main offshore wind energy development areas, Normandy, Southern Brittany, and the Mediter-ranean Sea. The study is based on 3 years of Meteo France AROME's data, available through the MeteoNet data-set. Using a 5 Gaussian Mixture Model for data clustering, it yields to optimal sensors' locations with regards to wind field reconstruction error. The proposed workflow is described and compared to state-of-the-art methods for sparse sampling. It constitutes a robust yet simple method for the definition of optimal sensor siting for offshore wind reconstruction. The described method yields to optimal network of 7, 4, and 4 sensors for Normandy, Southern Brittany and the Mediterranean Sea with a gain of approximately 20% in wind field reconstruction error compared to the median Monte Carlo case, and more than 30% compared to 10 state-of-the-art methods."
184,10.1186/s12889-018-6142-x,"Background Non-optimal blood pressure (BP) levels are a major cause of disease burden globally. We describe current BP and treatment patterns in rural India and compare different approaches to BP lowering in this setting. Methods All individuals aged ≥40 years from 54 villages in a South Indian district were invited and 62,194 individuals (84%) participated in a cross-sectional study. Individual 10-year absolute cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk was estimated using WHO/ISH charts. Using known effects of treatment, proportions of events that would be averted under different paradigms of BP lowering therapy were estimated. Results After imputation of pre-treatment BP levels for participants on existing treatment, 76·9% (95% confidence interval, 75.7–78.0%), 5·3% (4.9–5.6%), and 17·8% (16.9–18.8%) of individuals had a 10-year CVD risk defined as low (< 20%), intermediate (20–29%), and high (≥30%, established CVD, or BP > 160/100 mmHg), respectively. Compared to the 19.6% (18.4–20.9%) of adults treated with current practice, a slightly higher or similar proportion would be treated using an intermediate (23·2% (22.0–24.3%)) or high (17·9% (16.9–18.8%) risk threshold for instituting BP lowering therapy and this would avert 87·2% (85.8–88.5%) and 62·7% (60.7–64.6%) more CVD events over ten years, respectively. These strategies were highly cost-effective relative to the current practice. Conclusion: In a rural Indian community, a substantial proportion of the population has elevated CVD risk. The more efficient and cost-effective clinical approach to BP lowering is to base treatment decisions on an estimate of an individual’s short-term absolute CVD risk rather than with BP based strategy."
